The three men wore fake suicide vests \u2014 to make them even more imposing.", "The sister of a missing 32-year-old man said Monday her brother is believed to have died in the attack. Melissa McMullan told Sky News that police said her brother James McMullan\u2019s bank card had been found on one of the bodies.", "\u201cWhile our pain will never diminish, it is important for us all to carry on with our lives in direct opposition to those who wish to destroy us and remember that hatred is the refuge of small-minded individuals and will only breed more,\u201d she said.", "She said authorities are \u201cunable to formally identify him until the coroner\u2019s report begins tomorrow.\u201d London police say they cannot confirm the names of people caught up in the attack.", "It is not clear how having more police on the beat would have prevented the attack, since the men were shot dead within eight minutes, but the issue of police cuts has come back to haunt May, who served for six years at home secretary under her predecessor David Cameron before she became prime minister last year.", "During that time, police numbers have dropped by roughly 20,000 officers, and the number of armed officers has fallen as well.", "May said Monday that Britain\u2019s counterterrorism operations are fully funded, but London Mayor Sadiq Khan \u2014 a Labour figure \u2014 said cuts to police have been draconian.", "\u201cOver the last seven years, we as a city have lost 600 million pounds ($775 million) from our budget,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had to close police stations, sell police buildings and we\u2019ve lost thousands of police staff.\u201d", "The country\u2019s official terror threat level had been set at \u201ccritical\u201d in the parlous days after the Manchester concert bombing on May 22 that killed 22 people \u2014 reflecting a judgment that an attack might be imminent because accomplices with similar bombs might be on the loose.", "It was lowered once intelligence agencies were comfortable that this wasn\u2019t the case.

Not then. Not now.", "Or at least not yet.", "So what\u2019s the deal? Will it ever happen?", "That\u2019s a very definite maybe.", "In May 2014, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he expected the expanded playoffs to take effect in the 2015 season.", "\u201cI do believe it will be approved for the 2015 [season],\u201d Goodell said then.", "He also said at that point: \u201cI think we want to see one more year of, \u2018Will it impact the regular season in a positive way from a competitive standpoint? Will it create more excitement, more races towards the end about who\u2019s going to qualify for the playoffs?\u2019 And we also want to absorb the additional inventory into the marketplace from an advertising standpoint. We\u2019ll be able to do that.. . . So far we see positive signs in the marketplace. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to approach it.\u201d", "But then it didn\u2019t happen. The owners, who must ratify such a change, simply seemed to lose interest. And the measure, it appears, generates very little discussion these days among league leaders and the owners.", "That doesn\u2019t mean the idea has been discarded for good, however. It has been put aside, for sure. But it could be revisited in the next round of deliberations over the league\u2019s television contracts and its collective bargaining agreement.", "The entire conversation goes back to the last set of labor negotiations leading up to the 2011 CBA. The owners, remember, proposed an 18-game regular season with a reduced preseason. The players vehemently objected to a longer regular season and the owners dropped the proposal. They said they never would lengthen the regular season without the players\u2019 approval.", "But the owners did not drop the idea of shortening the preseason. Needing a way to boost revenues to offset the loss of revenues associated with a reduced preseason, the owners turned to an expanded postseason field, with a couple extra playoff games to sell to the TV networks.", "Under the proposed measure, seven teams in each conference would qualify for the playoffs instead of six. There would be only one team per conference given an opening-round postseason bye instead of two. So there would be six first-round playoff games leaguewide instead of four. One of them probably would be played on a Monday night.", "But there were (and are) issues. There were concerns about watering down the playoff field by allowing 44 percent of the league into the postseason rather than the current 38 percent. There also is a potential conflict between the prospective Monday night first-round playoff game and the college football playoffs.", "Does that mean it will never happen? No, it doesn\u2019t mean that.", "At some point, the NFL calendar will be revisited. The preseason still could be shortened. A longer regular season, either 17 or 18 games, could be reconsidered, although the players\u2019 approval remains the obvious obstacle there. So the expanded postseason could end up being reexamined as the revenue-boosting alternative. The current labor deal runs through 2020, and it makes sense to sort all of this out as the CBA and the next set of TV contracts are being hammered out.", "1. Seahawks say no to Kaepernick. . . So the Seattle Seahawks have taken a pass, at least for now, on signing Colin Kaepernick as their backup quarterback. That means their main alternative to Russell Wilson is Trevone Boykin. They\u2019d better hope their offensive line is much better than it has been or that Wilson remains as elusive and fortunate as he has been.", "2. Next for Kaepernick?. . . It now becomes a waiting game for Kaepernick. Teams are into their offseason programs and there is no catalyst, it seems, to prompt a signing sooner rather than later. It now appears likely that it will be at least into training camp before a team reconsiders its quarterback options and Kaepernick becomes an alternative somewhere.", "3. What about RG3?. . . If Kaepernick can\u2019t get a job, are there any prospects for Robert Griffin III? Could a team justify passing up Kaepernick, coming off a 16-touchdown, four-interception season in San Francisco, in favor of Griffin, coming off a two-touchdown, three-interception season in Cleveland?", "Of course, teams justified signing quarterbacks such as Blaine Gabbert and Ryan Fitzpatrick instead of Kaepernick. So perhaps signing Griffin wouldn\u2019t be too much of a stretch.", "4. Seahawks\u2019 strife. . . The Seahawks have done their best to try to dismiss the report by ESPN The Magazine about internal strife stemming from cornerback Richard Sherman\u2018s inability to let go of the ill-fated play call on the goal line that led to Wilson\u2019s Super Bowl-losing interception against the New England Patriots. Fine. It probably won\u2019t be an issue if the Seahawks have a successful season. But if things don\u2019t go so well, it won\u2019t be as easy for them to put this aside.", "5. Ravens\u2019 OTA injuries. . . Injuries obviously are part of football. But nothing is worse than injuries occurring in offseason practices. The Baltimore Ravens have been particularly hard hit this offseason with the torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered by cornerback Tavon Young and the hip injury, reportedly career threatening, suffered by tight end Dennis Pitta. Little to nothing is won in the NFL during the offseason. But plenty can be lost.", "6. Offseason restrictions. . . Keep such injuries in mind the next time NFL coaches talk about the need to roll back some of the restrictions on offseason practices put in place in the last labor deal. The NFL Players Association is very, very unlikely to agree to any rollbacks of those restrictions.", "7. On Norman. . . Josh Norman\u2019s recent comments to Bleacher Report about Dez Bryant and Odell Beckham Jr. were relatively tame, by his standards. Norman can say what he wants. But, really, has he played well enough since moving from the Carolina Panthers to the Washington Redskins to justify such inflammatory remarks? Not really taking a stand on that. Just wondering.", "8. On Cruz. . . Norman\u2019s comments came nowhere close to those made recently by Victor Cruz, however, after the veteran wide receiver signed with the Chicago Bears. Does Cruz really believe that the New York Giants purposefully suppressed his pass-catching numbers to make it easier to release him? This was a team that was starved for offensive production after a successful remake of its defense. If Cruz really believes that, he is deluding himself badly.", "9. On Osweiler. . .

But it also gave Congress a single program to hold accountable when elements of NextGen moved slowly, or not at all.", "Congress\u2019s perception that NextGen wasn\u2019t moving fast enough was amply bolstered by critical reports from the inspector general\u2019s office and from the Government Accountability Office.", "The FAA, however, has been able to point to success in recent years with some elements of NextGen.", "When Shuster revived the concept of moving the controllers and the NextGen program to a private nonprofit corporation run by a board of directors, one of the big four airlines \u2013 Delta \u2013 opposed the move and parted company with the lobbying group Airlines for America, which endorsed it.

No one needs a horse to get around these days; most don\u2019t even need a car anymore. But there remains a sense that things aren\u2019t completely decided. An entrepreneur can still make a claim, like, say, inventing a new industry around cannabis or fracking, and all of the opportunities of the West seem available once again. Denver, at the center of it all, still defines itself as it goes along.", "So does its foremost art museum, which has morphed and expanded along with the metropolis it calls home, and which is now assuming even more terrain with the exhibit \u201cThe Western: An Epic in Art and Film.\u201d The show, which runs through Sept. 10, is enlightening and entertaining, and something between pop culture and fine art.", "But make no mistake, this is a major move on DAM\u2019s part, a 21st-century land grab that, if successful, seals its reputation as the pre-eminent Western art institution in the United States.", "DAM \u2014 ambitiously \u2014 redefines and broadens the whole of idea of what is \u201cWestern,\u201d connecting in one display the Western paintings of Frederic Remington and Thomas Moran; the Western literature of Owen Wister and William Cullen Bryant; the Western photography of Carleton Watkins; the Western entertainment of Buffalo Bill; the Western films of John Ford and Sergio Leone; and the neo-Western art of Ed Ruscha, Andy Warhol and Kent Monkman.", "That is a long and diverse list, and to proclaim that all of those distinct genres are actually one thing is radical in its way. But this show builds a strong case for a new and holistic way of thinking about Western art, making links, appropriately for an art museum, through visuals. Curators Thomas Brent Smith and Mary Dailey Desmarais track the invention of Western images by the early painters and writers and then prove how they influenced the history and movements that came after them.", "The lessons are thorough but they\u2019re not hard. Just the opposite. Mainly because the evidence is presented via John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and the actual, red, white and blue motorcycle from \u201cEasy Rider,\u201d and through some of the most colorful, easy to look at paintings and illustrations ever made.", "When the exhibit announces the birth of the Western visual myth, it treats us to Albert Bierstadt\u2019s grand and glowing 1867 oil painting \u201cEmigrants Crossing the Plains,\u201d depicting a wagon train trekking before a glorious set of rocky peaks at sunset.", "When it introduces us to iconic characters and dramas of the story, it presents Alexander Phimister Proctor\u2019s precision-bronze\u00a0sculpture \u201clndian Warrior,\u201d and oil paintings, like Charles Marion Russell\u2019s action-packed 1899 robbery scene \u201cThe Hold-Up,\u201d and Charles Schreyvogel\u2019s \u201cBreaking Through the Line,\u201d which has\u00a0a Calvary soldier on horseback aiming his pistol directly at the viewer.", "When it wants to link us to literature, it has, set in glass cases, major artifacts, like early printings of George Catlin\u2019s illustrated \u201cLetters and Notes\u201d on Indian customs from 1832.", "And when the exhibit demonstrates how these scenic ideas became movies, it shows off with excerpts of cinematic wonders, such as Edwin S.

It bounces around a bit for expediency, but that lets it cover a lot of ground, and it allows for keen, convincing comparisons at several points when it directly juxtaposes two different art forms right next to each other so viewers can see what is borrowed. That happens spectacularly at the very entrance where Remington\u2019s 1889 \u201cA Dash for Timber\u201d painting of cowboys on horseback stands next to a sampler reel of Western movies that stole its scenery over the next century.

When we started Meow Wolf in 2008, (it was) right around same time Rhinoceropolis started and we were friends with the founders, so we had a connection to that for awhile. Denver right now is an incredibly vibrant creative community and, of course, it\u2019s been both energized by the movement of more youth and more millennials into the city, and it\u2019s also starting to be damaged by that growth. From what I\u2019ve experienced in meeting with the creative community of Denver there is a not just a real vibrancy, but a lot of sensitivity and a lot of negative narrative. Some people are upset and scared and angry by (the city\u2019s recent actions).", "Q: Did visiting Breckenridge in May (to speak at the Downtown Colorado Inc. and Colorado Creative Industries annual conventions) give you a more statewide perspective?", "A: Totally. I actually engaged a lot with representatives of rural and smaller Colorado creative communities. Colorado has this amazing infrastructure around the creative sector and has identified it as a piece of economic development, rather than what we have in New Mexico, which is cultural affairs. I think that\u2019s a really important and amazing distinction to witness. It\u2019s not about arts. It\u2019s about creative industry and creative economy, and that\u2019s progressive.\u00a0The coordination between a lot of the different districts in the creative economy was incredible to see.", "Q: On the other hand, what concerned you?", "A:\u00a0The things make me nervous are that the real spark of creativity happens in less-planned environments, and empty or chaotic environments. So my talk was largely based on that: letting all the people in the room who have done an incredible job of organizing and planning and centralizing and connecting know about it, but also to leave space for spontaneity. To me, that spontaneity is in a lot of ways embodied by the DIY arts and music venues, and if we over-plan how we do creative industry, then the people who are in those venues are going to be left behind. It\u2019s really important to recognize alternative spaces as being the genesis of creative vibrancy. Those can\u2019t get forgotten, lost, go unsupported or get homogenized.", "Q: To some extent, the Denver population and development boom echoes\u00a0what happened in Austin, Texas, and Portland, Ore., more than a decade ago, albeit with a less pronounced hipster element. What can we learn from those cities?", "A:\u00a0Austin is the perfect example of a creative community that is kind of on the other side of this (gentrification) arc, where there was a gritty, true kind of low-to-the-ground source of creativity happening and then everybody gets excited about that and the industry and planning and extraction of that source starts to happen. Places become hip, places become popular and then in that process those sources of creativity are left behind, and you\u2019re left with a city that is not nearly as weird or creative as it markets itself to be. That\u2019s what I would be afraid of for Denver. Everybody knows Denver as this cultural hot-spot right now and there\u2019s a reason why. It\u2019s important to support those who are bringing that true creativity.", "Q: Do you feel like New Mexico has anything to learn from Colorado?", "A:\u00a0New Mexico has a lot to learn from Colorado. As I mentioned, we think about art and the creative sector from a vantage point of nonprofits and cultural preservation and cultural affairs, and not economic drivers. Meow Wolf came about it from a completely different perspective and said, \u201cNow, this is going to be an economic driver,\u201d and it\u2019s been really successful. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity when you come at it that way.", "Q: You partnered with Denver Art & Venues this spring to hand out money to Denver DIY arts organizations. Can you go into that a little?", "A:\u00a0So really, all $54,000 is coming from us. Arts & Venues funded us $20,000 with the intent of us rolling it back into what we (distributed), so we took their $20,000 and made decisions with that in mind. They didn\u2019t provide the money directly to the recipients, and it was easier for us to be able to fund, sponsor or support entities that want to remain anonymous and that are wrapped up in some of these issues with their spaces. \u00a0Arts & Venues really wanted to be able to get money into the hands of venues that are at the most risk, but the Catch-22 there was that by funding them, they would have been exposing venues that are at the most risk. So it was just a funny thing. We figured out a way to do it that was safe for everyone.", "Q: Who received the money?", "A: The nine entities that approved being public are Fusion Factory, Fitch Foundation, Moon Magnet Collective, Denver Art Society, 7th Circle, Inca Church, Clown Cake, Pandemic Collective and Recreative Denver. There are five that I have not heard from from yet, and five that definitely want to remain anonymous.", "Q: What was the criteria for getting it?", "A: The criteria was longevity. We definitely wanted to support venues that had been doing it for awhile. It had to be a collective, not just one-person space, but really being supportive of other people. We wanted to support spaces that might have difficulty finding funds from more traditional sources. A couple thousand dollars is a big deal to some of these organizations.

Just look at what happened with craft beer.", "In September 1976, Congress passed legislation that cut the federal excise tax on beer from $9 to $7 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels produced, so long as a brewery produced no more than 2 million barrels annually (a 31-gallon barrel is equal to about two kegs).", "When President Gerald Ford signed the bill that same month, there were well under 100 breweries in the United States, and the number was shrinking fast amid industry consolidation and the high costs of doing business for smaller players. Analysts predicted perhaps two or three American breweries by the turn of the century \u2014 probably the big players such as Anheuser-Busch, Miller and Coors.", "A funny thing happened, though. The number of U.S. breweries rose steadily, crashing through 1,000 by the 1990s and then through 2,000 in the 21st century \u2014 about 1,997 more than analysts\u2019 predictions. The number now stands at more than 5,000, the most breweries operating at any one time in the nation\u2019s history.", "The vast majority of these operations are what are called craft breweries. They each make no more than a few million barrels annually, often much, much less than that for a local or a regional consumer base. And although they face challenges such as macro-breweries acquiring some of them, these craft breweries are by and large thriving. Together they have made America the delicious envy of the beer-making world in terms of style and experimentation.", "Craft distillers would love to follow in their footsteps. That is why a group representing smaller spirits producers is trying to get Congress and the Trump administration to cut the excise tax on smaller runs of whiskey, gin, vodka and more, like another government did for smaller amounts of beer 41 years ago.", "It would be a somewhat ironic role for President Donald Trump to play \u2014 one of America\u2019s few teetotaler presidents whose political hero nonetheless is early whiskey geek President Andrew Jackson.

Smaller brewers pay that $7-per-barrel tax rather than $9 on the first 60,000 beer barrels, and, under rules dating from 1991, smaller winemakers \u2014 those producing fewer than 250,000 non-sparkling gallons annually \u2014 receive a 90 percent credit on an excise tax of $1.07 per gallon for the first 100,000 gallons produced.", "Meanwhile, distillers of any size, whether conglomerates producing oceans of Jim Beam and Smirnoff, or boutique start-ups crafting artisanal spirits for local sales, pay $13.50 per proof gallon.", "These differences translate into a craft distiller paying six times as much in federal excise tax as a craft brewer and 17 times as much as a boutique vintner for the same amount of beverage. To balance things, the ACSA and its members want to reduce the federal excise tax to $2.70 per taxable gallon for the first 100,000 gallons produced.", "The idea is part of a larger Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, which includes sweeteners for vintners and breweries, too, such as a further beer tax cut (and, for that matter, the first federal definition for mead, the ancient drink made from fermented honey).", "The legislation has strong \u2014 and rare \u2014 bipartisan support, with dozens of co-sponsors on both sides of the aisle in both chambers. There\u2019s also the powerful argument that the cut would benefit that most sacrosanct example for American politicians, small business, as many of these craft distilleries are mom-and-pop-like start-ups.", "They also serve as a kind of research and development unit for the larger spirits industry, coming up with fresh spins on old styles and reaching new customers. It\u2019s no coincidence that the resurgence in cocktails during the past 10 years or so happened in near-tandem with the rise of craft spirits.", "Attempts at such a change have stalled before in Washington, including during the previous Congress, but America\u2019s smaller distilleries think they have a real shot this go-round, particularly because of the bipartisan support.

And 70 percent of sheriffs thought that law enforcement should be allowed to ask about individuals\u2019 citizenship status during routine patrols.

Most sheriffs (almost nine out of 10) report that they check for immigration status when someone is arrested for a violent crime or booked into jail, which complies with ICE\u2019s requirements under the Obama administration.

A sheriff\u2019s attitudes about immigrants were not associated with whether the office checks the immigration status of those convicted of crimes or booked into jail; across the board, 88 percent of sheriffs said that was their department policy.", "Immigrants are reporting fewer crimes.", "According to the news site FiveThirtyEight, since Trump\u2019s inauguration immigrants in three major cities are reporting fewer crimes to police.

While the public is more familiar with the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Britain and the United States, the German-U.S. relationship has arguably been more important. One of the key purposes of NATO was to embed Germany in an international framework that would prevent it from becoming a threat to European peace as it had been in World War I and World War II. In the words of NATO\u2019s first secretary general, NATO was supposed \u201cto keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.\u201d Now, Merkel is suggesting that the Americans aren\u2019t really in, and, by extension, Germany and Europe are likely to take on a much more substantial and independent role than they have in the past 70 years.", "\u00a0This is thanks to Trump", "Merkel\u2019s comment about what she has experienced in the past few days is a clear reference to President Donald Trump\u2019s disastrous European tour. Her belief that the United States is no longer a reliable partner is a direct result of Trump\u2019s words and actions. The keystone of NATO is Article 5, which has typically been read as a commitment that in the event that one member of the alliance is attacked, all other members will come to its aid. When Trump visited NATO, he dedicated a plaque to the one time that Article 5 has been invoked \u2014 when all members of NATO promised to come to the United States\u2019 support after the attack on Sept. 11, 2001. However, Trump did not express his commitment to Article 5 in his speech to NATO, instead lambasting other NATO members for not spending enough money on their militaries. When Trump went on to the Group of Seven meeting in Italy, he declined to recommit to the Paris agreement on climate change, leaving the other six nations to issue a separate statement.", "This cements the impression of the United States as an unreliable partner. Trump has ostentatiously refused to express his commitment to an agreement that has been the bulwark of Europe-U.S. security relations over the past three generations. He also has declined to say that the United States will work within the previously agreed framework on global warming. While many authoritarian states are cheered by Trump\u2019s election and actions, since he is unlikely to press them on human rights and other sore points, traditional U.S. allies are enormously disheartened.", "This may lead to a stronger Europe", "Merkel\u2019s rhetoric is clearly intended to imply that as the trans-Atlantic relationship grows weaker, the European Union will grow stronger. When she links Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union with U.S. unreliability, she suggests that now that Britain is gone, it will be possible for the E.U. to concentrate on getting its own affairs in order, propelled by a stronger relationship between Germany and France. Britain always wanted to keep trans-Atlantic security institutions, such as NATO, strong, which sometimes meant pushing back against giving the E.U. a new security role. Now that Britain is no longer going to be part of the E.U., it will no longer have veto power.", "However, Merkel will face her own challenges in building a stronger Europe. Europe faces several internal disagreements. States such as Poland and Hungary agree more with Trump than with Germany on many issues. Southern European countries still resent Germany\u2019s support of painful and (for them) damaging austerity policies. If Germany wants to cooperate with France on security, France is likely to look to Germany to make concessions on economic governance and spending. Although Merkel has recently hinted that such concessions might be possible, they will be controversial with other German politicians (including senior members of her party) and perhaps with the German public. Finally, the criticisms offered by Trump (and many U.S. leaders before him) are not entirely wrong \u2013 European states spend much less on their militaries than the United States does on its military and have effectively outsourced much of their defense to U.S. armed forces.", "Still, it is important to note that Merkel\u2019s temperament is the polar opposite of Trump\u2019s. She is highly cautious. This speech is not an impulsive move. Instead, Merkel is starting to make the case for a different E.U., one that is stronger, more self-reliant and disinclined to look to the United States for leadership. If she wins the upcoming German election decisively and is able to secure enough agreement from other European states to isolate the naysayers, she may set in motion a substantial long-term shift in the E.U.-U.S. relationship.", "Trump\u2019s election may have long-term global consequences", "People have not yet seriously begun to think through the consequences of Trump\u2019s election for global politics. In some parts of the world, it is creating great opportunities. States whose interests clash with the United States may now have opportunities to win gains while the United States, the global hegemon, is distracted with its internal crises. In other parts of the world, allies are likely to recalibrate their behavior, and in particular their dependence on the United States.

If inspired or directed by the Islamic State, it will only serve to strengthen the resolve of the people of Britain who want to see the radical group defeated. Manchester has experienced Irish-related terrorism in the past, and its citizens will demonstrate to the world how resilient it remains.", "Now Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, and counterterrorism police units, whose capacity is already severely stretched from dealing with the Westminster terrorist attack just eight weeks ago, are likely to come under pressure as they face questions about why another apparently \u201cknown\u201d extremist was not prevented from killing so many.", "One explanation is the unprecedented recent surge in threats against Britain from Islamic State-inspired attacks. British authorities have actually been able to stop many such attempts; London\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command at Scotland Yard successfully disrupted three separate terrorist plots (mostly involving knives) in the past four weeks, two within a 24-hour period. All of the would-be perpetrators, including four women, were subsequently charged with terrorist offenses. They had all been living in Britain for years; they were not foreign fighters returning from the collapsing \u201ccaliphate,\u201d but known extremists inspired to act largely through access to radicalizing material on the Internet and social media contact with terrorists overseas. It appears that Salman Abedi, named as the suicide bomber responsible for the Manchester attack, may have had a similar profile, having been born and raised in the city to parents who originated from Libya.", "The investigation into this attack will be led by the Manchester Counter Terrorism Unit. The unit was established after 7/7, when officials recognized that a lack of counterterrorism capability outside London might have contributed to poor intelligence on the 2005 attackers, most of whom lived in and around Leeds. Britain\u2019s modern counterterrorism police network is now fully interoperable, with units embedded in all the major cities. Coordinated from London, police specialists from across Britain are now supplementing investigative resources being deployed from the Manchester unit. The police network has tested and exercised the response to an attack of this nature many times, and the investigation will undoubtedly be well-led and coordinated.", "Counterterrorism professionals readily acknowledge, however, that the only meaningful performance measure is an absence of terrorist attacks. And Britain has now experienced two mass casualty attacks in its two largest cities in the past two months. In a rare public comment, Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, said Monday that his staff was \u201crelentlessly focused\u201d on fighting terrorism. In the aftermath of these attacks, he is likely to direct that the agency urgently reassess all \u201cknown\u201d Britain-based extremists to see whether any merit more intrusive surveillance and covert operational activity. The raising of the threat level in Britain to \u201ccritical\u201d by the Joint Terrorist Analysis Center confirms that MI5 is not ruling out further linked attacks by outstanding suspects.", "The spike in terrorist plotting is likely to continue for months \u2014 even years \u2014 to come, despite military successes in Iraq and Syria. The harder it is for radicals to get from Britain to Islamic State-held land, the likelier it is they\u2019ll try to strike in the West. The end of the \u201cphysical\u201d caliphate may be near, but the \u201cvirtual\u201d caliphate online will endure. The lesson from the Westminster and Manchester attacks is surely that mass-fatality terrorism does not need to be complex or particularly sophisticated, such as the attacks carried out in Paris in December 2015. Lone individuals can easily be inspired to kill many people with knives, cars and homemade bombs; British officials rarely have to worry about disrupting plots with guns, thanks to our strict firearms laws. The only way of preventing such attacks is by knowing the mind-set and intent of the extremists and then disrupting their planning, either through good intelligence and covert monitoring or by family or communities reporting their concerns to police.", "Serious questions will now be asked across Britain about its Muslim communities and whether Muslim leaders and role models are saying and doing enough to counter the poisonous narratives emanating from Islamic terrorist groups. Despite the existence of a mature and well-developed national terrorism prevention strategy in Britain, hundreds of largely British-born nationals have left the country in the past four years to join the \u201ccaliphate,\u201d and one has to ask what more needs to be done to prevent this particularly potent brand of Islamic extremism from flourishing.", "The British government will be particularly concerned about a potential lack of community cohesion in the northwest of England after this attack, which is vulnerable to a backlash against Muslim minority communities. The region is less integrated than many other parts of Britain, and extremist right-wing groups have gained ground there, as evidenced by the terrorist murder of the British lawmaker Jo Cox by Thomas Mair last year.", "While there is clearly no one solution to the ongoing threats across the world from Islamist terrorism, one has to hope that initiatives like the creation of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, launched in Saudi Arabia this month, will make a difference. Bold steps such as this, particularly involving Muslim nations, could mean that fewer families will be scarred by terrorism in the future.", "It is an unintended consequence, but the advent of social media has placed a turbo charge on extremism, providing a vehicle for extremist narratives to be propagated across the world and joining up like-minded proponents.

Many of my classmates in Granby were smarter and more capable than I was, yet never got the same shot. This same vigor and determination has inspired our rural Colorado colleges to innovate, to do more with less, and to provide opportunities to capable and underprivileged young people.", "But there is hope.

No, but it is a good story about everyone ultimately doing the right thing.", "Helping rural colleges match high demand jobs with a workforce ready to work should be a no-brainer.

Our organization hopes to create a future in which our campus and our country are venues for free and fair political discussion and debate from all sides. We stand for the preservation of spaces where political ideas can be shared and challenged without fear of violence.", "To that end, we decided to bring Coulter to Berkeley to speak to a body of mainly liberal students on immigration. Unfortunately, threatened attacks from extremist groups forced the cancellation of this event. Let\u2019s be clear: Blame for the cancellation of Coulter\u2019s speech does not rest solely on the shoulders of any individual. The administration, student groups including ours, external resistance groups and the media all made mistakes that need to be corrected. Fundamentally, though, the system of political dialogue and debate is broken, not just on this campus, but across the nation.", "We formed our organization earlier this year after the infamous Milo Yiannopoulos event here, where an incendiary speaker, violent rioters and a divided nation combined to create the perfect storm of political controversy. The university canceled a speech in February by Yiannopoulos, a prominent conservative writer, after intense protests that led to a campuswide \u201cshelter in place\u201d order. That day, instigation and violence replaced mediation and conversation \u2014 and we wanted to repair this breakdown in communication. Our goal since then has been to facilitate dialogue between political opposites, allowing everyone to engage with and understand opposing viewpoints. We have so far been successful in hosting forum sessions and debates on a series of different issues. We\u2019ve hosted five events in about two months. Many students were immediately interested in our mission, and our membership has expanded rapidly \u2014 we have 40 officers and about 150 to 200 members.", "Coulter was the choice of conservative groups on campus to represent their perspective in a larger campus debate about illegal immigration we were hosting. Liberal groups on campus had chosen Maria Echaveste, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton. She spoke on April 17 and answered questions from conservative students in the audience.", "Coulter\u2019s ideas have an audience, and though most members of our group disagree with her, we recognize the following she draws. We also understand that many see her as an inflammatory figure with destructive beliefs that disqualify her from appearing at an institution of higher learning. But we believe the only productive way to fight views one sees as bad or dangerous is with better views. So we chose to get involved and include Coulter in our speaker series on immigration so students could hear, and actively challenge, her views.", "We planned for the event to be a debate-style, question-and-answer session with rebuttals to allow for a dialogue. Coulter would have fielded tough questions about her views from students in the audience, and we would have done our part to ensure that she would answer those questions in their entirety and give students the opportunity to respond. Rather than repeating the failures of Yiannopoulos\u2019 event, we wanted to create a national example for what free discourse and the questioning of ideas should look like here at Berkeley, the home of the free speech movement 50 years ago.", "Free speech isn\u2019t about provocation, violence, publicity stunts, selling books or testing limits. At their best, universities start and nurture conversations that advance dialogue and understanding further. Regrettably, the developments surrounding this event led it to fall out of line with our beliefs as an organization.", "National media coverage of Coulter\u2019s visit mostly overlooked BridgeUSA\u2019s role and our plan for the event, instead reporting that the incident was a repeat of the Yiannopoulos fracas \u2014 exactly what we set out to avoid. And as the tensions between student safety and free speech entered the justice system, Yiannopoulos himself announced that he would be organizing a \u201cfree speech week\u201d on Sproul Plaza where he and his supporters would attack a new perceived \u201cenemy of free speech\u201d every day. It pains me to see our campus being used as a pulpit for bad actors, people whose goal is to elevate themselves by inciting violence, without a thought for the safety of students who live and attend school here.", "Sproul Plaza is becoming a battleground, and the ones who are left to pick up the bill of consequences are\u00a0Berkeley\u2019s students, who is vilified every day in the press for destruction that outside groups are responsible for. Antifa and other \u201cblack-bloc\u201d groups that are able to organize do so far beyond the perimeters of our campus, and they receive an insignificant amount of support from Berkeley students, if any. But in national news, all that\u2019s seen is violence and destruction being used to censor speech.", "What disheartens me is seeing the words \u201cfree speech\u201d used as a tool to garner headlines and publicity. The whole purpose behind the idea of free speech has been lost. What\u2019s happening on our campus is no longer about advancing discourse or trying to reach a larger truth and understanding about policy issues so that better decisions can be made. It\u2019s just a furious chase to get in front of the news cameras and be trending on Twitter and Facebook.", "Conservative groups, in their attempt to frame this complex series of events as a \u201cfree speech battle\u201d by suing Berkeley\u2019s administration, have used the label of free speech as a tool for publicity. Our organization prides itself on the values of free inquiry and discourse, yet we understand the impossible trade-off that the university faces: the administration is caught between upholding its commitment to free speech and its responsibility for student safety.", "The administration attempted to work with us, to propose alternative dates this semester and next semester where a defensible venue would be available. In balancing the concerns of protecting students and allowing peaceful protest, they never backed down from their commitment to help us bring Coulter to campus. It is easy and expedient to blame the university in this situation, but that avoids the actual problem. The true issue here is not the way that the university handled this situation; rather, it is the fact that this trade-off between student safety and free speech even exists in the first place.", "It\u2019s a scary situation when the university cannot perfectly perform its duty, when it cannot guarantee the safety of all speakers at all times in all places. Those who would threaten student safety and destroy our campus to silence speech they disagree with are culpable for the existence of this new trade-off. And violence and threats which restrict the free exchange of ideas constitute fascism under the banner of anti-fascism.", "We challenge the Berkeley administration, the Berkeley College Republicans and Coulter to work collaboratively and address the cancellation of the event and the current political climate. These respective parties continue to affirm their commitment to free speech, but they have demonstrated minimal effort in speaking freely with one another. Civil discussions are necessary to progress our democracy and address pressing points of contention.", "We can alleviate polarization if we come to the table to talk, but until then, there is no constructive way forward. Threatening violence does not change minds, and instigating controversy for publicity does not fix a broken system. We, as a community, have to recognize that there is a world outside of Berkeley: How can we promote what we believe if we are associated with images of violence? We need to act with the knowledge that everyone is watching.", "We refuse to meet speech with violence and oppression. We refuse to invoke the right to free speech to inflame, attack and generate publicity. We refuse to accept the current status quo surrounding speech on university campuses across the country. Instead, we will continue to pursue our mission of creating environments in which students can engage with their peers as free thinkers, express their opinions without fear and have their beliefs, suppositions and prejudices challenged rather than dismissed. Only through these means can we begin to bridge the gap brought on by polarization and allow for a free exchange of political ideas.", "Pranav Jandhyala is a freshman at the University of California at Berkeley, where he is the founder and co-president of BridgeUSA.

The entire point is to head-off supply constraints; in other words, to reduce ratepayer electricity demand and thereby avoid \u00a0the need to build costly new power plants. To this end, lawmakers in 2007 passed HB 1037, which established a target for Colorado utilities to reduce peak demand and retail electricity sales 5 percent below 2006 levels by 2018.", "The happy news is that utilities met the target. The state\u2019s largest monopoly utility, Xcel Energy, now has almost 400 megawatts of surplus supply. The fundamental purpose behind demand-side management, which is to avoid building new capacity, is no longer applicable.", "There are other reasons to be wary of continuing with a program that costs ratepayers so much money. In the most recent strategic issues docket for demand-side management, it was established that the marginal cost of these policies is increasing. All the low-hanging fruit has been plucked. At the same time, the \u201cbenefits\u201d of the program are diminishing, due to low natural gas prices and a host of federal energy efficiency standards implemented during the Obama administration.", "Also, the market is already moving towards the adoption of some of Xcel\u2019s demand-side programs, such as energy efficient lighting, without charging ratepayers $100 million per year.", "Given all these reasons, why did the General Assembly re-authorize the program?", "One explanation we heard from supporters was that this bill is a climate change policy. If so, then it\u2019s a grossly inefficient one. In 2016, Xcel stated that the demand-side program reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 330,000 tons, at a cost of about $110 million (including utility incentives). Do the math. That\u2019s about $330/ton, an astoundingly high cost.", "Even the CO2 adverse Obama administration only considered a $20-$40/ton social cost of carbon (the supposed societal cost of emitting a ton of CO2). Xcel\u2019s demand-side program reduces greenhouse gases at a cost that is 8 to 16 times more expensive than the harm allegedly wrought by the emissions. In any context, that\u2019s a horrible deal!", "Another explanation we heard from sponsor Sen. Kevin Priola, R-Adams County, is that the policy somehow saves ratepayers money. That\u2019s just wrong.", "First, remember that Xcel has surplus capacity so there is no need for ratepayers to pay Xcel extra money to \u201cmanage\u201d their demand. Second, the PUC just allowed Xcel to build an inefficient, $1 billion industrial wind project with a mere 51 megawatts capacity value, despite the fact that there are no supply constraints. So Priola has it backwards. In fact, unwise investments like industrial wind and demand-side policies are reasons why electricity rates have skyrocketed 67 percent over the last decade plus in Colorado.", "The one other justification we heard for keeping the program is that it enjoys \u201cbipartisan\u201d support. Bipartisan support for bad and expensive policy doesn\u2019t miraculously change it to good policy, especially when it costs ratepayers more than $100 million annually for no discernible purpose.", "If lawmakers really want to save ratepayers money, then stop social engineering electricity use through government rate manipulation and consider real-time pricing instead. The ratepayer resources given to demand-side management would be much better spent installing the technology needed to inform consumers how much their electricity costs as they use it. Consumers would modify their behavior accordingly, which would both reduce bills and resolve the engineering issues associated with peak demand.", "Unfortunately, we have yet to see a courageous Colorado legislature where the majority puts ratepayers\u2019 wallets ahead of its need to social engineer electricity use and monopoly utility interests.", "William Yeatman, an energy policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, can be reached at William.Yeatman@cei.org.", "Amy Oliver Cooke, directs energy policy at the Independence Institute.

Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney mused whether the CBO\u2019s time had \u201ccome and gone,\u201d for which he was appropriately pilloried from all sides. His response was to double down, claiming that the \u201cCBO has exhibited a history of flawed analysis and inaccurate findings.\u201d", "First off, let\u2019s think about the messenger here. For Mulvaney to attack the CBO for the quality of its analysis is like a kid who can\u2019t add challenging Einstein to a math duel. It\u2019s not just that the Trump budget over which he presided had gimmicks; that\u2019s not uncommon. It was the extent of the gimmicks, most notably, the double counting of tax cuts that not only paid for themselves but magically raised another $2 trillion in revenues. Enter \u201cMick Mulvaney double counting\u201d in Google, and you get about 43,000 results.", "Second, you can\u2019t take anything this guy (or his boss) says seriously. Remember how Trump inveighed against the Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs numbers until he got into office and the bureau released a good jobs report? To great laughs from the press corps, White House press secretary Sean Spicer \u2014 yet another guy you can\u2019t trust \u2014 announced that at least for that month, the president believed the numbers. Let\u2019s see the distance Mulvaney puts between himself and the CBO when the agency releases a score he likes.", "Mulvaney is also the guy who, when confronted with the pain caused in the lives of the poor by cutting spending on programs that help them by $2.5 trillion, responded: \u201c[W]e are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs. We\u2019re going to measure compassion and success by the number of people we help get off of those programs and get back in charge of their own lives.\u201d That\u2019s some deeply cynical rhetoric.", "It\u2019s not surprising that those who spout such nonsense and so blatantly cook the books would go after the refs, which obviously makes the refs that much more important. Let\u2019s be crystal clear about this: Facts are not the friends of the Trump administration, especially regarding budgets, deficits, and implausible economic assumptions \u2014 all the stuff the nonpartisan CBO tracks.", "Just because Mulvaney is in way over his head, that doesn\u2019t mean the CBO is perfect. But his criticism evinces a fundamental lack of understanding of the budget agency\u2019s inherent assignment and its inevitable limitations. The most essential, most valuable aspect of the CBO \u2013 the reason it\u2019s not just important, but increasingly important \u2014 is its nonpartisanship. If the people in power got to choose their own scorekeeper, Mulvaney-style bookkeeping would be the last word. Instead, once the CBO scores the budget, we\u2019ll be able to see its impact on our fiscal accounts that does not double-count and that uses widely accepted methods and growth assumptions.", "Of course, \u201cwidely accepted\u201d does not mean correct. CBO faces the same limits as any other forecasting operation, and if there\u2019s one thing economists do badly, it\u2019s forecasting. However, what matters most in CBOs case is not that its guesstimates are any more or less accurate than anyone else\u2019s; it\u2019s that the agency is not leaning one way of the other to get a preferred result. CBO gives us the mainstream results, the ones you\u2019d get if you weren\u2019t trying to stack the deck one way of the other, and, given the proliferation of dealers from the bottom of the deck, such information is essential.", "A legitimate criticism to the above is, \u201cSure, that makes sense regarding budgets, but Mulvaney was whining about the health-care score, and that\u2019s less mainstream because widely accepted assumptions don\u2019t exist for aspects of that policy.\u201d How, for example, does one model which states will apply for waivers from various requirements under the law when there\u2019s no historical record for such actions? (In fact, the CBO handled this smartly by looking carefully at states\u2019 health coverage practices before the ACA was upon the land.)", "That\u2019s a fair critique, one taken up in a thoughtful piece by Yuval Levin in the National Review. While praising CBO\u2019s professionalism and integrity, Levin argues for at least two reforms; One, the agency should be more transparent, releasing, for example, their models so outside experts can better understand how they get their results and the sensitivities of the embedded parameters. Two, they should produce their results with confidence intervals, as opposed to just point estimates, the way pollsters often do (\u201cCandidate X is ahead 2 points within a 3-point margin of error\u201d).", "I like both of these ideas, even though they come with some risks and limits. Levin notes that policymakers who understand the CBO\u2019s models often game the system by crafting proposals they know will score well, based on known modeling assumptions. There\u2019s a risk that broader exposure to the models would lead to more such gaming, but I think that\u2019s a risk worth taking. The benefits of shining a light into black boxes outweigh their costs.", "I, too, have long advocated for error bands around estimates, a practice which is fairly common at similar agencies in other countries. But coming up with such ranges is often impossible. Take the state waivers example above. Since there\u2019s no historical record, there\u2019s no probabilistic model I know of that would enable reliable error margins. On the other hand, budget forecasts can be so modeled. In fact, the OMB makes precisely such estimates, but don\u2019t tell Mulvaney!", "The pushback on this point is that Congress needs a point estimate, not a range. But again, I believe the benefits of being transparent about our uncertainty outweigh the false certainty of presenting the best guess by itself.", "But these are all nuances that are beside the larger point, which is this: Those in power don\u2019t care about the facts, the models, the margins of error. Their agenda is to abuse their power on behalf of their wealthiest supporters at great expense to the rest of us.", "CBO is one bulwark against such abuse, something Trump and Mulvaney instinctively recognize.

In so doing, the court applied a new statistical measure called the \u201cefficiency gap.\u201d", "Developed by the University of Chicago Law School and the Public Policy Institute of California, the efficiency gap theory is effectively porn for the hardcore political junkie. It measures the number of wasted votes \u2014 either a vote cast for a losing candidate or vote cast for a winning candidate in excess of what was necessary. The plaintiffs explained it through a cavalcade of charts, S-curves and graphs meant to simplify the dense mathematical underpinning. The outcome measures a party\u2019s vote share against the number of expected wins in the legislature. For example, the plaintiffs argued that Wisconsin Republicans held only 48.2\u00a0percent of the vote share, but were favored in 59 out of 100 districts.", "At first blush, it sounds like a perfect solution. The efficiency gap is fair, based in rigorous mathematical principles, and avoids the guesswork so common with\u00a0these maps.", "But it comes at a cost. To employ the analysis, it requires a priority above other important factors. In Colorado, those factors include city and county lines, the compactness of a district, and communities of interest. In search of a fair map, districts may cut across those lines and dissect neighborhoods. Common interests would be sacrificed to cold mathematical outcomes.", "All of that, and I am not even sure the outcome really produces a fair result. Or at least a desirable one. First, it relies on a party\u2019s vote share from prior elections to project into the future. That is a dubious proposition on several fronts.

This repeal bill, officially designated as H.R. 10 and named the Financial CHOICE Act, is better described as the \u201cWrong Choice Act\u201d because it puts financial predators back in charge of our economy.", "While H.R. 10 deregulates Wall Street trading, in some cases removing rules enacted after the stock market crash of 1929, my focus here is on how the Wrong Choice Act would hurt the average consumer by gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The Dodd-Frank law created the CFPB because the financial crisis showed that there was a need for a government agency whose sole focus was to make sure consumer protection laws were enforced and consumers were protected across all areas in the financial marketplace.", "Since its creation, the CFPB has returned approximately $12 billion to 29 million consumers who had been defrauded and taken advantage of by financial companies. This includes relief for consumers who were victims of Wells Fargo\u2019s unauthorized accounts scheme, credit card holders tricked into buying fraudulent add-on products, homeowners who were illegally foreclosed on, students charged more than they owed by student loan servicers, and African-, Hispanic-, and Asian-American borrowers who experienced discriminatory interest rate markups by automobile lenders.", "The Wrong Choice Act would essentially eliminate the CFPB\u2019s authority to take these types of enforcement actions, supervise financial institutions, and issue rules that protect consumers. It\u00a0would also make the CFPB director fire-able at will by a president who has had to settle multiple personal lawsuits for breaking consumer protection laws.", "The bill would gravely weaken a range of borrower protections in the housing market, including the CFPB\u2019s rule requiring lenders to verify that borrowers can afford their mortgage. Have the bill authors forgotten the housing crisis?", "The Wrong Choice Act would prevent the CFPB from issuing any consumer protection regulation for debt collection, binding arbitration clauses, or payday, car-title, or similar small dollar loans. It would also permit lenders to circumvent state laws governing consumer loans. Unscrupulous lenders \u2014\u00a0aka loan sharks \u2014\u00a0target low-income Americans with products designed to entrap them in a never-ending cycle of debt.

For six years PERA officials insisted that the reforms adopted in the wake of the Great Recession had put the system on a timely path to solvency. And so Smith now blames the current quest for a new set of reforms on two relatively recent events.", "First, PERA\u2019s board last year lowered the expected rate of return by a quarter-point, to 7.25 percent, on the reasonable belief that future market gains are likely to average less than in the past. Second, the board adopted new mortality tables to reflect the apparently startling insight, in Smith\u2019s view, that \u201cwe\u2019re finding that people are living longer.\u201d Moreover, \u201cpeople in white collar jobs have traditionally and historically lived longer and that\u2019s continuing to develop.\u201d", "Indeed it is. For that matter, Smith is correct that these two changes resulted in a notable adjustment in the fund\u2019s financial status.\u00a0 But it is also the case that PERA\u2019s full funding was supposed to be achieved 30 years after the 2010 reforms \u2014\u00a0in other words, around 2040 \u2014\u00a0and that date had been pushed back repeatedly long before the recent adjustments while the unfunded liability increased. Now full funding for the state division is estimated at 55 years, and for the schools division that date is even more remote \u2014\u00a0time frames so lengthy they border on the meaningless.", "Smith may be right that PERA \u201cis not in crisis.\u201d\u00a0 Its \u201cStop Light Technology\u201d puts most of its divisions in orange, one step above the red that signals all-out emergency. But the fact that PERA is, in Smith\u2019s own words, \u201ctoo close to the edge to withstand\u201d another market meltdown is precisely because of management\u2019s dogged resistance to some of the very reforms it is finally about to consider.", "Among potential steps acknowledged by Smith during PERA\u2019s town hall: raising the retirement age, hiking the employee contribution, adjusting cost-of-living increases, and moving to the highest five-years of salary for retirement benefits.", "\u201cWe believe by addressing the promises being made to future generations, as well as other components of benefits that are payable today \u2026 we can reduce that risk profile,\u201d he said.", "PERA\u2019s board and then the legislature will ultimately decide the nature of any reform package.

For Mulvaney to attack the CBO for the quality of its analysis is like a kid who can\u2019t add challenging Einstein to a math duel. It\u2019s not just that the Trump budget over which he presided had gimmicks; that\u2019s not uncommon. It was the extent of the gimmicks, most notably, the double counting of tax cuts that not only paid for themselves but magically raised another $2 trillion in revenues. Enter \u201cMick Mulvaney double counting\u201d in Google, and you get about 43,000 results.", "Second, you can\u2019t take anything this guy (or his boss) says seriously. Remember how Trump inveighed against the Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs numbers until he got into office and the bureau released a good jobs report? To great laughs from the press corps, White House press secretary Sean Spicer \u2014 yet another guy you can\u2019t trust \u2014 announced that at least for that month, the president believed the numbers. Let\u2019s see the distance Mulvaney puts between himself and the CBO when the agency releases a score he likes.", "Mulvaney is also the guy who, when confronted with the pain caused in the lives of the poor by cutting spending on programs that help them by $2.5 trillion, responded: \u201c[W]e are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs. We\u2019re going to measure compassion and success by the number of people we help get off of those programs and get back in charge of their own lives.\u201d That\u2019s some deeply cynical rhetoric.", "It\u2019s not surprising that those who spout such nonsense and so blatantly cook the books would go after the refs, which obviously makes the refs that much more important. Let\u2019s be crystal clear about this: Facts are not the friends of the Trump administration, especially regarding budgets, deficits, and implausible economic assumptions \u2014 all the stuff the nonpartisan CBO tracks.", "Just because Mulvaney is in way over his head, that doesn\u2019t mean the CBO is perfect. But his criticism evinces a fundamental lack of understanding of the budget agency\u2019s inherent assignment and its inevitable limitations. The most essential, most valuable aspect of the CBO \u2013 the reason it\u2019s not just important, but increasingly important \u2014 is its nonpartisanship. If the people in power got to choose their own scorekeeper, Mulvaney-style bookkeeping would be the last word. Instead, once the CBO scores the budget, we\u2019ll be able to see its impact on our fiscal accounts that does not double-count and that uses widely accepted methods and growth assumptions.", "Of course, \u201cwidely accepted\u201d does not mean correct. CBO faces the same limits as any other forecasting operation, and if there\u2019s one thing economists do badly, it\u2019s forecasting. However, what matters most in CBOs case is not that its guesstimates are any more or less accurate than anyone else\u2019s; it\u2019s that the agency is not leaning one way of the other to get a preferred result. CBO gives us the mainstream results, the ones you\u2019d get if you weren\u2019t trying to stack the deck one way of the other, and, given the proliferation of dealers from the bottom of the deck, such information is essential.", "A legitimate criticism to the above is, \u201cSure, that makes sense regarding budgets, but Mulvaney was whining about the health-care score, and that\u2019s less mainstream because widely accepted assumptions don\u2019t exist for aspects of that policy.\u201d How, for example, does one model which states will apply for waivers from various requirements under the law when there\u2019s no historical record for such actions? (In fact, the CBO handled this smartly by looking carefully at states\u2019 health coverage practices before the ACA was upon the land.)", "That\u2019s a fair critique, one taken up in a thoughtful piece by Yuval Levin in the National Review. While praising CBO\u2019s professionalism and integrity, Levin argues for at least two reforms; One, the agency should be more transparent, releasing, for example, their models so outside experts can better understand how they get their results and the sensitivities of the embedded parameters. Two, they should produce their results with confidence intervals, as opposed to just point estimates, the way pollsters often do (\u201cCandidate X is ahead 2 points within a 3-point margin of error\u201d).", "I like both of these ideas, even though they come with some risks and limits. Levin notes that policymakers who understand the CBO\u2019s models often game the system by crafting proposals they know will score well, based on known modeling assumptions. There\u2019s a risk that broader exposure to the models would lead to more such gaming, but I think that\u2019s a risk worth taking. The benefits of shining a light into black boxes outweigh their costs.", "I, too, have long advocated for error bands around estimates, a practice which is fairly common at similar agencies in other countries. But coming up with such ranges is often impossible. Take the state waivers example above. Since there\u2019s no historical record, there\u2019s no probabilistic model I know of that would enable reliable error margins. On the other hand, budget forecasts can be so modeled. In fact, the OMB makes precisely such estimates, but don\u2019t tell Mulvaney!", "The pushback on this point is that Congress needs a point estimate, not a range. But again, I believe the benefits of being transparent about our uncertainty outweigh the false certainty of presenting the best guess by itself.", "But these are all nuances that are beside the larger point, which is this: Those in power don\u2019t care about the facts, the models, the margins of error. Their agenda is to abuse their power on behalf of their wealthiest supporters at great expense to the rest of us.", "CBO is one bulwark against such abuse, something Trump and Mulvaney instinctively recognize.

In the most recent strategic issues docket for demand-side management, it was established that the marginal cost of these policies is increasing. All the low-hanging fruit has been plucked. At the same time, the \u201cbenefits\u201d of the program are diminishing, due to low natural gas prices and a host of federal energy efficiency standards implemented during the Obama administration.", "Also, the market is already moving towards the adoption of some of Xcel\u2019s demand-side programs, such as energy efficient lighting, without charging ratepayers $100 million per year.", "Given all these reasons, why did the General Assembly re-authorize the program?", "One explanation we heard from supporters was that this bill is a climate change policy. If so, then it\u2019s a grossly inefficient one. In 2016, Xcel stated that the demand-side program reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 330,000 tons, at a cost of about $110 million (including utility incentives). Do the math. That\u2019s about $330/ton, an astoundingly high cost.", "Even the CO2 adverse Obama administration only considered a $20-$40/ton social cost of carbon (the supposed societal cost of emitting a ton of CO2).

That\u2019s just wrong.", "First, remember that Xcel has surplus capacity so there is no need for ratepayers to pay Xcel extra money to \u201cmanage\u201d their demand. Second, the PUC just allowed Xcel to build an inefficient, $1 billion industrial wind project with a mere 51 megawatts capacity value, despite the fact that there are no supply constraints. So Priola has it backwards. In fact, unwise investments like industrial wind and demand-side policies are reasons why electricity rates have skyrocketed 67 percent over the last decade plus in Colorado.", "The one other justification we heard for keeping the program is that it enjoys \u201cbipartisan\u201d support. Bipartisan support for bad and expensive policy doesn\u2019t miraculously change it to good policy, especially when it costs ratepayers more than $100 million annually for no discernible purpose.", "If lawmakers really want to save ratepayers money, then stop social engineering electricity use through government rate manipulation and consider real-time pricing instead.

Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney mused whether the CBO\u2019s time had \u201ccome and gone,\u201d for which he was appropriately pilloried from all sides. His response was to double down, claiming that the \u201cCBO has exhibited a history of flawed analysis and inaccurate findings.\u201d", "First off, let\u2019s think about the messenger here. For Mulvaney to attack the CBO for the quality of its analysis is like a kid who can\u2019t add challenging Einstein to a math duel. It\u2019s not just that the Trump budget over which he presided had gimmicks; that\u2019s not uncommon. It was the extent of the gimmicks, most notably, the double counting of tax cuts that not only paid for themselves but magically raised another $2 trillion in revenues. Enter \u201cMick Mulvaney double counting\u201d in Google, and you get about 43,000 results.", "Second, you can\u2019t take anything this guy (or his boss) says seriously. Remember how Trump inveighed against the Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs numbers until he got into office and the bureau released a good jobs report? To great laughs from the press corps, White House press secretary Sean Spicer \u2014 yet another guy you can\u2019t trust \u2014 announced that at least for that month, the president believed the numbers. Let\u2019s see the distance Mulvaney puts between himself and the CBO when the agency releases a score he likes.", "Mulvaney is also the guy who, when confronted with the pain caused in the lives of the poor by cutting spending on programs that help them by $2.5 trillion, responded: \u201c[W]e are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs. We\u2019re going to measure compassion and success by the number of people we help get off of those programs and get back in charge of their own lives.\u201d That\u2019s some deeply cynical rhetoric.", "It\u2019s not surprising that those who spout such nonsense and so blatantly cook the books would go after the refs, which obviously makes the refs that much more important. Let\u2019s be crystal clear about this: Facts are not the friends of the Trump administration, especially regarding budgets, deficits, and implausible economic assumptions \u2014 all the stuff the nonpartisan CBO tracks.", "Just because Mulvaney is in way over his head, that doesn\u2019t mean the CBO is perfect. But his criticism evinces a fundamental lack of understanding of the budget agency\u2019s inherent assignment and its inevitable limitations. The most essential, most valuable aspect of the CBO \u2013 the reason it\u2019s not just important, but increasingly important \u2014 is its nonpartisanship. If the people in power got to choose their own scorekeeper, Mulvaney-style bookkeeping would be the last word. Instead, once the CBO scores the budget, we\u2019ll be able to see its impact on our fiscal accounts that does not double-count and that uses widely accepted methods and growth assumptions.", "Of course, \u201cwidely accepted\u201d does not mean correct. CBO faces the same limits as any other forecasting operation, and if there\u2019s one thing economists do badly, it\u2019s forecasting. However, what matters most in CBOs case is not that its guesstimates are any more or less accurate than anyone else\u2019s; it\u2019s that the agency is not leaning one way of the other to get a preferred result. CBO gives us the mainstream results, the ones you\u2019d get if you weren\u2019t trying to stack the deck one way of the other, and, given the proliferation of dealers from the bottom of the deck, such information is essential.", "A legitimate criticism to the above is, \u201cSure, that makes sense regarding budgets, but Mulvaney was whining about the health-care score, and that\u2019s less mainstream because widely accepted assumptions don\u2019t exist for aspects of that policy.\u201d How, for example, does one model which states will apply for waivers from various requirements under the law when there\u2019s no historical record for such actions? (In fact, the CBO handled this smartly by looking carefully at states\u2019 health coverage practices before the ACA was upon the land.)", "That\u2019s a fair critique, one taken up in a thoughtful piece by Yuval Levin in the National Review. While praising CBO\u2019s professionalism and integrity, Levin argues for at least two reforms; One, the agency should be more transparent, releasing, for example, their models so outside experts can better understand how they get their results and the sensitivities of the embedded parameters. Two, they should produce their results with confidence intervals, as opposed to just point estimates, the way pollsters often do (\u201cCandidate X is ahead 2 points within a 3-point margin of error\u201d).", "I like both of these ideas, even though they come with some risks and limits. Levin notes that policymakers who understand the CBO\u2019s models often game the system by crafting proposals they know will score well, based on known modeling assumptions. There\u2019s a risk that broader exposure to the models would lead to more such gaming, but I think that\u2019s a risk worth taking. The benefits of shining a light into black boxes outweigh their costs.", "I, too, have long advocated for error bands around estimates, a practice which is fairly common at similar agencies in other countries. But coming up with such ranges is often impossible. Take the state waivers example above. Since there\u2019s no historical record, there\u2019s no probabilistic model I know of that would enable reliable error margins. On the other hand, budget forecasts can be so modeled. In fact, the OMB makes precisely such estimates, but don\u2019t tell Mulvaney!", "The pushback on this point is that Congress needs a point estimate, not a range. But again, I believe the benefits of being transparent about our uncertainty outweigh the false certainty of presenting the best guess by itself.", "But these are all nuances that are beside the larger point, which is this: Those in power don\u2019t care about the facts, the models, the margins of error. Their agenda is to abuse their power on behalf of their wealthiest supporters at great expense to the rest of us.", "CBO is one bulwark against such abuse, something Trump and Mulvaney instinctively recognize.

When we started Meow Wolf in 2008, (it was) right around same time Rhinoceropolis started and we were friends with the founders, so we had a connection to that for awhile. Denver right now is an incredibly vibrant creative community and, of course, it\u2019s been both energized by the movement of more youth and more millennials into the city, and it\u2019s also starting to be damaged by that growth. From what I\u2019ve experienced in meeting with the creative community of Denver there is a not just a real vibrancy, but a lot of sensitivity and a lot of negative narrative. Some people are upset and scared and angry by (the city\u2019s recent actions).", "Q: Did visiting Breckenridge in May (to speak at the Downtown Colorado Inc. and Colorado Creative Industries annual conventions) give you a more statewide perspective?", "A: Totally. I actually engaged a lot with representatives of rural and smaller Colorado creative communities. Colorado has this amazing infrastructure around the creative sector and has identified it as a piece of economic development, rather than what we have in New Mexico, which is cultural affairs. I think that\u2019s a really important and amazing distinction to witness. It\u2019s not about arts. It\u2019s about creative industry and creative economy, and that\u2019s progressive.\u00a0The coordination between a lot of the different districts in the creative economy was incredible to see.", "Q: On the other hand, what concerned you?", "A:\u00a0The things make me nervous are that the real spark of creativity happens in less-planned environments, and empty or chaotic environments. So my talk was largely based on that: letting all the people in the room who have done an incredible job of organizing and planning and centralizing and connecting know about it, but also to leave space for spontaneity. To me, that spontaneity is in a lot of ways embodied by the DIY arts and music venues, and if we over-plan how we do creative industry, then the people who are in those venues are going to be left behind. It\u2019s really important to recognize alternative spaces as being the genesis of creative vibrancy. Those can\u2019t get forgotten, lost, go unsupported or get homogenized.", "Q: To some extent, the Denver population and development boom echoes\u00a0what happened in Austin, Texas, and Portland, Ore., more than a decade ago, albeit with a less pronounced hipster element. What can we learn from those cities?", "A:\u00a0Austin is the perfect example of a creative community that is kind of on the other side of this (gentrification) arc, where there was a gritty, true kind of low-to-the-ground source of creativity happening and then everybody gets excited about that and the industry and planning and extraction of that source starts to happen. Places become hip, places become popular and then in that process those sources of creativity are left behind, and you\u2019re left with a city that is not nearly as weird or creative as it markets itself to be. That\u2019s what I would be afraid of for Denver. Everybody knows Denver as this cultural hot-spot right now and there\u2019s a reason why. It\u2019s important to support those who are bringing that true creativity.", "Q: Do you feel like New Mexico has anything to learn from Colorado?", "A:\u00a0New Mexico has a lot to learn from Colorado. As I mentioned, we think about art and the creative sector from a vantage point of nonprofits and cultural preservation and cultural affairs, and not economic drivers. Meow Wolf came about it from a completely different perspective and said, \u201cNow, this is going to be an economic driver,\u201d and it\u2019s been really successful. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity when you come at it that way.", "Q: You partnered with Denver Art & Venues this spring to hand out money to Denver DIY arts organizations. Can you go into that a little?", "A:\u00a0So really, all $54,000 is coming from us. Arts & Venues funded us $20,000 with the intent of us rolling it back into what we (distributed), so we took their $20,000 and made decisions with that in mind. They didn\u2019t provide the money directly to the recipients, and it was easier for us to be able to fund, sponsor or support entities that want to remain anonymous and that are wrapped up in some of these issues with their spaces. \u00a0Arts & Venues really wanted to be able to get money into the hands of venues that are at the most risk, but the Catch-22 there was that by funding them, they would have been exposing venues that are at the most risk. So it was just a funny thing. We figured out a way to do it that was safe for everyone.", "Q: Who received the money?", "A: The nine entities that approved being public are Fusion Factory, Fitch Foundation, Moon Magnet Collective, Denver Art Society, 7th Circle, Inca Church, Clown Cake, Pandemic Collective and Recreative Denver. There are five that I have not heard from from yet, and five that definitely want to remain anonymous.", "Q: What was the criteria for getting it?", "A: The criteria was longevity. We definitely wanted to support venues that had been doing it for awhile. It had to be a collective, not just one-person space, but really being supportive of other people. We wanted to support spaces that might have difficulty finding funds from more traditional sources. A couple thousand dollars is a big deal to some of these organizations. And there was no dictation on how it was to be used.", "Q: You\u2019ve reportedly visited Denver several times to meet with developers and landlords for another Meow Wolf location \u2014 which will be much bigger than the Santa Fe one. What can you say about that?", "A: We have a few locations that we have identified, a couple of really strong possibilities, and we\u2019re just trying to work out a deal.

Zai had tapped into a fast-growing market for so-called \u201cmodest fashion,\u201d fueled by young, style-savvy Muslim women from London to Malaysia who have long felt their needs ignored by mainstream designers.", "\u201cI just couldn\u2019t relate at all to the clothes you see in the mainstream brands,\u201d she said from her home in Rotterdam. \u201cWhen we first started talking about our style on social media, there was no interest in the fashion world in this group of people: \u2018They\u2019re just Muslims, why should we target them?'\u201d", "Big brands have been waking up to that call, and covered-up chic is a niche that\u2019s slowly making its way into mainstream fashion. From exclusive designers to fast-fashion chains, retailers are trying to court millions of Muslim consumers \u2014 especially around the month of Ramadan, which started last week, when many Muslims buy new clothes and dress up. In 2014, U.S. fashion house DKNY was one of the first Western brands to launch a Ramadan collection aimed at wealthy Arab shoppers.", "Since then several others have followed suit. Dolce&Gabbana has been selling a luxury collection of abayas \u2014 long, loose robe-like dresses \u2014 and matching headscarves since 2016 in the Middle East, Paris and London. At the more affordable end of the market, Spanish chain Mango is also promoting a Ramadan collection of tunics, kaftans and maxi dresses for the second year.", "Earlier this year Nike became the first major brand to launch a \u201cpro hijab,\u201d a headscarf made in high-tech fabrics aimed at female Muslim athletes. Even Marks and Spencer, that stalwart British department store known for cardigans and practical shoes, launched a burkini \u2014 a full-body swimsuit \u2014 last summer.", "But perhaps the most visible sign yet that mainstream fashion is embracing the Muslim market was when design houses Max Mara and Alberta Ferretti starred hijab-wearing Somali-American model Halima Aden on their catwalks for Milan Fashion Week, one of the industry\u2019s most prestigious events.", "\u201cMainstream fashion is now talking about modest fashion as a thing. Ten years ago, if you were a brand coming from a religious background and tried to sell it in a department store, calling it a modest or Muslim brand would be a kiss of death,\u201d said Reina Lewis, a professor at the London College of Fashion who has written two books about the topic.", "While the majority of those interested in covered-up fashion are young, cosmopolitan Muslim women, \u201cthe term \u2018modesty\u2019 emerged in the niche market as a useful one because it\u2019s not faith-specific,\u201d Lewis added.", "\u201cI know Christians and atheist friends who don\u2019t cover their heads but they dress this way because that\u2019s how they feel most comfortable, said Zai, the blogger.", "Nazmin Alim, a designer who founded London-based modest fashion brand Aab a decade ago, says she used to have to buy fabric herself and visit a tailor to get smart work wear that still adhered to her faith\u2019s modesty edicts.", "\u201cLong skirts may have a slit, tops may be sleeveless,\u201d she said. \u201cWe understood then that, do you know what?

Jackson, Brad Pitt and Gwen Stefani moved into a Pennsylvania factory last year from China, executives with the Bollman Hat Co. billed it as an effort to create U.S. manufacturing jobs.", "But as labor costs went up, profits went down. Way down. The 149-year-old company behind Kangol says it\u2019s losing money on every kangaroo-logo cap knitted at its factory in Adamstown, 60 miles west of Philadelphia.", "\u201cIt has been certainly a bigger challenge than what we could\u2019ve ever dreamed,\u201d said Don Rongione, Bollman\u2019s fedora-wearing president and CEO.", "The nation\u2019s oldest hatmaker expects a relatively quick turnaround once U.S. workers get better at making the popular Kangol caps. But Bollman\u2019s early struggles with Kangol illustrate why the labor-intensive garment industry left the United States in the first place.", "Employment is down 85 percent since 1990 \u2014 the biggest decline of any manufacturing sector \u2014 as cost-cutting apparel companies shifted production to Asia in search of cheaper labor. Bollman spends about $11 an hour per worker in Pennsylvania vs. $2.60 in China.", "So why move?", "In an industry where trends come and go quickly, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important to incorporate speed into the delivery of the product,\u201d Rongione said.", "Other apparel companies also are trying to be more nimble. U.S. apparel production has increased 50 percent since 2009, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association, as some footwear and clothing makers decided to accept higher labor costs in exchange for greater inventory control and proximity to U.S. customers.", "KEEN, for example, began assembling footwear at a plant in Portland, Ore., in 2010. Sportswear giant Under Armour opened a high-tech facility in Baltimore last year.", "\u201cObviously, if you have a plant in the United States, it\u2019s much easier to respond to trends, produce small runs and get product to market really quickly,\u201d said Nate Herman, the trade group\u2019s senior vice president of supply chain.", "Last year, for the first time in decades, the number of manufacturing jobs created by U.S. companies that moved operations back to the nation and by foreign companies investing in America exceeded the number of jobs lost by companies moving overseas, according to the Reshoring Initiative, a nonprofit set up to bring factory jobs back to the United States.", "Yet the U.S. garment industry\u2019s production gains also show why President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. could prove difficult. Increased automation is making it cheaper to sew and knit in the U.S. but requires fewer workers. So, even as apparel makers crank out more U.S.-made shirts and shoes, the industry is losing more jobs than it\u2019s creating. Employment stood at more than 131,000 workers last year, down from a high of 1.4 million in 1973.", "Moreover, more than 97 percent of America\u2019s wardrobe still comes from abroad.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be what it once was,\u201d said Steven Frumkin, of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to employ as many people because of efficiencies and equipment.\u201d", "Bollman is betting it can succeed with U.S. workers \u2014 and by making Kangol, its most important brand, the old-fashioned way.", "The employee-owned company raised more than $100,000 through a Kickstarter campaign to ship dozens of knitting machines from China to Pennsylvania, then got to work refurbishing the ancient, clattering workhorses that have been knitting the fabric used in Kangol caps for nearly 80 years. American workers also had to learn how to sew, shape and embroider the distinctive headwear, a popular style of which, the Wool 504, retails for $48.", "Nearly a year later, Bollman\u2019s overall cost per hat is still twice as high as it was in Asia, partly because the Pennsylvania crew can\u2019t yet produce as many hats in a day as their more experienced counterparts at the now-shuttered factory in Panyu, in southern China. But the cost per hat was three times as high initially, and the company says it expects continued improvement.", "Inside Bollman\u2019s 19th century, red-brick factory in Pennsylvania Dutch country, Amaryllis Garman, 38, carefully places a piece of knitted fabric on a machine that joins both ends to form the familiar Kangol flat cap, taking care to ensure a straight line. The job requires patience and hand-eye coordination, and comes with a steep learning curve.", "When Garman started, she could make 10 hats a day. She\u2019s up to about 250 now and hopes to become still more efficient.", "\u201cI was ready to give up,\u201d Garman said with a rueful laugh. \u201cVery difficult, but once you accomplish it, it\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d", "Bollman has spent more than $1 million to shift production to Pennsylvania, putting a financial strain on a company whose brand lineup also includes Helen Kaminski and Country Gentleman. There was no profit sharing in 2016, and, for the first time in 31 years, the company did not make a contribution to its employee stock ownership plan.", "The Adamstown factory is responsible for about 20 percent of Kangol production, with the rest coming from plants in England, Italy, Taiwan, China and Vietnam.", "The venerable hatmaker, which has produced just about every style over its long history, from trilbies and pork pies to bowlers and berets, is no stranger to adversity. Foreign competition forced painful layoffs at the Pennsylvania factory last decade as Bollman\u2019s domestic production declined from 3.2 million hats in 2005 to about 460,000 last year. The experience prompted Rongione to start American Made Matters, an advocacy group that encourages consumers to buy U.S.-made goods.", "Bollman acquired Kangol, an English brand that gained cachet in the U.S. when hip-hop pioneers like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J began sporting it, in 2001. By then, production already had moved to China.", "Bollman has to start making money on its U.S.-made Kangol headwear or it\u2019ll eventually have to ship production back overseas, Rongione said.", "But the CEO said he remains optimistic.", "\u201cThis is not yet a success story,\u201d Rongione said, \u201cbut we have great confidence we\u2019re going to get there. \u2026 This is near and dear to our hearts.\u201d"], "pubdate": ["Sun, 04 Jun 2017 06:03:21 +0000"], "title": ["Move hatmaking into a U.S. factory?

No one needs a horse to get around these days; most don\u2019t even need a car anymore. But there remains a sense that things aren\u2019t completely decided. An entrepreneur can still make a claim, like, say, inventing a new industry around cannabis or fracking, and all of the opportunities of the West seem available once again. Denver, at the center of it all, still defines itself as it goes along.", "So does its foremost art museum, which has morphed and expanded along with the metropolis it calls home, and which is now assuming even more terrain with the exhibit \u201cThe Western: An Epic in Art and Film.\u201d The show, which runs through Sept. 10, is enlightening and entertaining, and something between pop culture and fine art.", "But make no mistake, this is a major move on DAM\u2019s part, a 21st-century land grab that, if successful, seals its reputation as the pre-eminent Western art institution in the United States.", "DAM \u2014 ambitiously \u2014 redefines and broadens the whole of idea of what is \u201cWestern,\u201d connecting in one display the Western paintings of Frederic Remington and Thomas Moran; the Western literature of Owen Wister and William Cullen Bryant; the Western photography of Carleton Watkins; the Western entertainment of Buffalo Bill; the Western films of John Ford and Sergio Leone; and the neo-Western art of Ed Ruscha, Andy Warhol and Kent Monkman.", "That is a long and diverse list, and to proclaim that all of those distinct genres are actually one thing is radical in its way. But this show builds a strong case for a new and holistic way of thinking about Western art, making links, appropriately for an art museum, through visuals. Curators Thomas Brent Smith and Mary Dailey Desmarais track the invention of Western images by the early painters and writers and then prove how they influenced the history and movements that came after them.", "The lessons are thorough but they\u2019re not hard. Just the opposite. Mainly because the evidence is presented via John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and the actual, red, white and blue motorcycle from \u201cEasy Rider,\u201d and through some of the most colorful, easy to look at paintings and illustrations ever made.", "When the exhibit announces the birth of the Western visual myth, it treats us to Albert Bierstadt\u2019s grand and glowing 1867 oil painting \u201cEmigrants Crossing the Plains,\u201d depicting a wagon train trekking before a glorious set of rocky peaks at sunset.", "When it introduces us to iconic characters and dramas of the story, it presents Alexander Phimister Proctor\u2019s precision-bronze\u00a0sculpture \u201clndian Warrior,\u201d and oil paintings, like Charles Marion Russell\u2019s action-packed 1899 robbery scene \u201cThe Hold-Up,\u201d and Charles Schreyvogel\u2019s \u201cBreaking Through the Line,\u201d which has\u00a0a Calvary soldier on horseback aiming his pistol directly at the viewer.", "When it wants to link us to literature, it has, set in glass cases, major artifacts, like early printings of George Catlin\u2019s illustrated \u201cLetters and Notes\u201d on Indian customs from 1832.", "And when the exhibit demonstrates how these scenic ideas became movies, it shows off with excerpts of cinematic wonders, such as Edwin S. Porter\u2019s 1903 \u201cThe Great Train Robbery,\u201d 1952\u2019s \u201cHigh Noon\u201d and 2007\u2019s \u201cNo Country for Old Men.\u201d", "The exhibit is well-executed, both in its high-quality objects and installation. It bounces around a bit for expediency, but that lets it cover a lot of ground, and it allows for keen, convincing comparisons at several points when it directly juxtaposes two different art forms right next to each other so viewers can see what is borrowed. That happens spectacularly at the very entrance where Remington\u2019s 1889 \u201cA Dash for Timber\u201d painting of cowboys on horseback stands next to a sampler reel of Western movies that stole its scenery over the next century. And it happens stunningly halfway through when it places a large, Franz Kline abstract canvas, \u201cPalladio,\u201d\u00a0next to a still from John Ford\u2019s film\u00a0 \u201cThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\u201d What does a prototypical abstractionist painting have in common with a satirical Western? Both were made in 1961, both in black-and-white, and both show how, post-World War II, notions of art turned cynical, irreverent and self-obsessed.", "\u201cThe Western\u201d is the kind of exhibit you spend time with, hours even, mostly because there are lots of film clips to sit through, and they\u2019re all compelling.

The best thing that could happen to \u201cspaghetti Western\u201d film director Sergio Leone is to have a credible art museum place his works next to Remingtons. His cinematic moves are elevated here but, it turns out, not artificially.", "The exhibit is less kind to the overall nature of Western art in general.\u00a0 From the earliest works here, like Catlin\u2019s 1932 painting of an Indian chief, to the later looks at regional icons such as Calamity Jane, the art of the West seems trumped up and reduced for effect. It looks imagined and made-to-sell, whether the product is the art itself, the magazines and books it appeared in,\u00a0or the idea of Westward expansion.", "In nearly every painting and sculpture, the scenery is too perfect and the views are conveniently packaged to enhance their romantic nature; we know now that most of the West was actually flat and dusty and kind of boring. The European characters look like heroes, when actually they were Indian killers, and the Indians look like those condescending \u201cnoble savages\u201d or like a pitiful, vanquished lot \u2014 which they were not.", "The question the show raises is: Was Western art ever honest?\u00a0 Or was it always propaganda?\u00a0 Was Western life and history ever captured for anything other than its exotic qualities or to sell commercial and political ideas? The stuff could be beautiful, technically amazing and journalistic, but was it ever really art?", "This show allows for a lot of conclusions on the part of the viewer, many negative, and that is reinforced in the final section of the exhibit, which focuses on contemporary art and film. All of the works here\u00a0carry on the tradition of depicting landscape, cowboys and Indians, but nearly all of them call out the earlier Western art for its exaggerations, fabrications, sexism, racism, homophobia, nationalism and various other crimes against nature.", "What are we to make of a piece like Gail Tremblay\u2019s 2012 sculpture \u201cIt Was Never About Playing Cowboys and Indians,\u201d which weaves actual 16mm film into a sort of patterned American Indian basket? Or Kent Monkman\u2019s \u201cBoudoir de Berdashe,\u201d which turns a teepee into a boudoir for a fictional and exaggerated Native American drag queen, complete with mock, vintage Western films with homoerotic overtones? Or a poster from the movie \u201cBlazing Saddles\u201d or a clip from the campy \u201cThelma and Louise?\u201d", "Does all of the Western art from the last 50 years exist simply to make fun of the Western art in the 100 years that preceded it? The answer, according to this exhibit, appears to be yes \u2014 because it skipped a meaningful incorporation of later Western artists who work with the same vistas without dwelling in full parody,\u00a0a spectrum that started with Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Ansel Adams. It is either this exhibit\u2019s greatest strength \u2014 that it admits and accepts that baloney is at the heart of the Western genre \u2014 or its greatest weakness, undermining the concept that all of this material, strung together, is great American art.", "That makes it a must-see, despite the fact that there is an extra (and anti-visitor) fee\u00a0to see it.", "This is a landmark show, not just because of the questions it raises, but also because it\u2019s never been done to this degree.

When we started Meow Wolf in 2008, (it was) right around same time Rhinoceropolis started and we were friends with the founders, so we had a connection to that for awhile. Denver right now is an incredibly vibrant creative community and, of course, it\u2019s been both energized by the movement of more youth and more millennials into the city, and it\u2019s also starting to be damaged by that growth. From what I\u2019ve experienced in meeting with the creative community of Denver there is a not just a real vibrancy, but a lot of sensitivity and a lot of negative narrative. Some people are upset and scared and angry by (the city\u2019s recent actions).", "Q: Did visiting Breckenridge in May (to speak at the Downtown Colorado Inc. and Colorado Creative Industries annual conventions) give you a more statewide perspective?", "A: Totally. I actually engaged a lot with representatives of rural and smaller Colorado creative communities. Colorado has this amazing infrastructure around the creative sector and has identified it as a piece of economic development, rather than what we have in New Mexico, which is cultural affairs. I think that\u2019s a really important and amazing distinction to witness. It\u2019s not about arts. It\u2019s about creative industry and creative economy, and that\u2019s progressive.\u00a0The coordination between a lot of the different districts in the creative economy was incredible to see.", "Q: On the other hand, what concerned you?", "A:\u00a0The things make me nervous are that the real spark of creativity happens in less-planned environments, and empty or chaotic environments. So my talk was largely based on that: letting all the people in the room who have done an incredible job of organizing and planning and centralizing and connecting know about it, but also to leave space for spontaneity. To me, that spontaneity is in a lot of ways embodied by the DIY arts and music venues, and if we over-plan how we do creative industry, then the people who are in those venues are going to be left behind. It\u2019s really important to recognize alternative spaces as being the genesis of creative vibrancy. Those can\u2019t get forgotten, lost, go unsupported or get homogenized.", "Q: To some extent, the Denver population and development boom echoes\u00a0what happened in Austin, Texas, and Portland, Ore., more than a decade ago, albeit with a less pronounced hipster element. What can we learn from those cities?", "A:\u00a0Austin is the perfect example of a creative community that is kind of on the other side of this (gentrification) arc, where there was a gritty, true kind of low-to-the-ground source of creativity happening and then everybody gets excited about that and the industry and planning and extraction of that source starts to happen. Places become hip, places become popular and then in that process those sources of creativity are left behind, and you\u2019re left with a city that is not nearly as weird or creative as it markets itself to be. That\u2019s what I would be afraid of for Denver. Everybody knows Denver as this cultural hot-spot right now and there\u2019s a reason why. It\u2019s important to support those who are bringing that true creativity.", "Q: Do you feel like New Mexico has anything to learn from Colorado?", "A:\u00a0New Mexico has a lot to learn from Colorado. As I mentioned, we think about art and the creative sector from a vantage point of nonprofits and cultural preservation and cultural affairs, and not economic drivers. Meow Wolf came about it from a completely different perspective and said, \u201cNow, this is going to be an economic driver,\u201d and it\u2019s been really successful. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity when you come at it that way.", "Q: You partnered with Denver Art & Venues this spring to hand out money to Denver DIY arts organizations. Can you go into that a little?", "A:\u00a0So really, all $54,000 is coming from us. Arts & Venues funded us $20,000 with the intent of us rolling it back into what we (distributed), so we took their $20,000 and made decisions with that in mind. They didn\u2019t provide the money directly to the recipients, and it was easier for us to be able to fund, sponsor or support entities that want to remain anonymous and that are wrapped up in some of these issues with their spaces. \u00a0Arts & Venues really wanted to be able to get money into the hands of venues that are at the most risk, but the Catch-22 there was that by funding them, they would have been exposing venues that are at the most risk. So it was just a funny thing. We figured out a way to do it that was safe for everyone.", "Q: Who received the money?", "A: The nine entities that approved being public are Fusion Factory, Fitch Foundation, Moon Magnet Collective, Denver Art Society, 7th Circle, Inca Church, Clown Cake, Pandemic Collective and Recreative Denver. There are five that I have not heard from from yet, and five that definitely want to remain anonymous.", "Q: What was the criteria for getting it?", "A: The criteria was longevity. We definitely wanted to support venues that had been doing it for awhile. It had to be a collective, not just one-person space, but really being supportive of other people. We wanted to support spaces that might have difficulty finding funds from more traditional sources. A couple thousand dollars is a big deal to some of these organizations.

Increased automation is making it cheaper to sew and knit in the U.S. but requires fewer workers. So, even as apparel makers crank out more U.S.-made shirts and shoes, the industry is losing more jobs than it\u2019s creating. Employment stood at more than 131,000 workers last year, down from a high of 1.4 million in 1973.", "Moreover, more than 97 percent of America\u2019s wardrobe still comes from abroad.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be what it once was,\u201d said Steven Frumkin, of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to employ as many people because of efficiencies and equipment.\u201d", "Bollman is betting it can succeed with U.S. workers \u2014 and by making Kangol, its most important brand, the old-fashioned way.", "The employee-owned company raised more than $100,000 through a Kickstarter campaign to ship dozens of knitting machines from China to Pennsylvania, then got to work refurbishing the ancient, clattering workhorses that have been knitting the fabric used in Kangol caps for nearly 80 years. American workers also had to learn how to sew, shape and embroider the distinctive headwear, a popular style of which, the Wool 504, retails for $48.", "Nearly a year later, Bollman\u2019s overall cost per hat is still twice as high as it was in Asia, partly because the Pennsylvania crew can\u2019t yet produce as many hats in a day as their more experienced counterparts at the now-shuttered factory in Panyu, in southern China. But the cost per hat was three times as high initially, and the company says it expects continued improvement.", "Inside Bollman\u2019s 19th century, red-brick factory in Pennsylvania Dutch country, Amaryllis Garman, 38, carefully places a piece of knitted fabric on a machine that joins both ends to form the familiar Kangol flat cap, taking care to ensure a straight line. The job requires patience and hand-eye coordination, and comes with a steep learning curve.", "When Garman started, she could make 10 hats a day. She\u2019s up to about 250 now and hopes to become still more efficient.", "\u201cI was ready to give up,\u201d Garman said with a rueful laugh. \u201cVery difficult, but once you accomplish it, it\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d", "Bollman has spent more than $1 million to shift production to Pennsylvania, putting a financial strain on a company whose brand lineup also includes Helen Kaminski and Country Gentleman. There was no profit sharing in 2016, and, for the first time in 31 years, the company did not make a contribution to its employee stock ownership plan.", "The Adamstown factory is responsible for about 20 percent of Kangol production, with the rest coming from plants in England, Italy, Taiwan, China and Vietnam.", "The venerable hatmaker, which has produced just about every style over its long history, from trilbies and pork pies to bowlers and berets, is no stranger to adversity. Foreign competition forced painful layoffs at the Pennsylvania factory last decade as Bollman\u2019s domestic production declined from 3.2 million hats in 2005 to about 460,000 last year.

Superman\u201d and hopelessly muddled \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d a year ago, the DC Comics franchise has received an invigorating shot in the metal-cuffed arm of handsome design and snappy storytelling. An indifferent box office promises to get a lift from a genuinely novel protagonist as enigmatic as she is compelling. And women \u2014 long expected to internalize myths of exaggerated male potency as their own \u2014 finally have a symbolic universe that feels, if not entirely corrective, at least imaginatively in keeping with their own hopes, dreams and realities.", "\u201cWonder Woman\u201d may not cure all the ills of pop culture\u2019s superhero-saturation syndrome; in fact, in many ways it succumbs to some of its worst excesses. But at least it brings an exhilarating, vicarious kick to the sagging, bagging table.", "The fact that the movie succeeds so well is all the more surprising given the fact that it\u2019s an origin story, a notorious b\u00eate noire for narrative efficiency. After a brief prologue set in modern-day Paris (presumably shortly after the title character\u2019s encounter with Batman last summer), the movie plunges into flashback, when the young Amazon princess Diana is living on an idyllic island called Themyscira with her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and secretly training with the fierce Amazon general Antiope (Robin Wright). When a handsome World War I pilot crash-lands offshore, Diana \u2014 played as an adult by Gal Gadot \u2014 rescues him, which leads to a battle with German forces who are ultimately felled by the women\u2019s acrobatic swordplay, superb equestrian skills, uncanny aim with flaming arrows and all-around badassery.", "It\u2019s a stirring, almost giddy scene, all these sisters doin\u2019 it for themselves in gladiator sandals and messy fishtail braids. And the rest of the film lives up to that early promise, as Diana and the pilot \u2014 a cocksure Yank named Steve Trevor (not to be confused with Marvel\u2019s similarly all-American Steve Rogers) \u2014 leave the island to go save the world from mass destruction. For Trevor, the mission is to stop a German general and his star inventor from unleashing chemical weapons on Allied forces; for Diana, it\u2019s nothing less than stopping Ares, the Greek god of war, forever and ever, amen.", "Working from a serviceable script by Allan Heinberg, director Patty Jenkins injects all the right values into \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d making it swiftly moving, convincing and legible \u2014 and often dazzling to look at. Embracing the story\u2019s comic-book roots, Jenkins gives even such realist settings as Edwardian London and the trenches of No Man\u2019s Land a burnished, illustrative sense of the fabulist. With wardrobes spanning from fur, metal and leather to fine silks, steampunk goggles and prosthetic masks, this is by far the most visually sophisticated and rewarding DC movie yet.\nDC Comics-Warner Bros. PicturesGal Gadot and Chris Pine in \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d  (DC Comics-Warner Bros.

(He\u2019s particularly amusing when his character is wrapped in Diana\u2019s glowing Lasso of Truth, which forces him to say things utterly inimical to his macho pride.) Together, he and Gadot develop a gratifyingly coy, low-key vibe of mutual attraction and camaraderie. A sequence late in the film, set in a French hotel room near the front, is both understated and authentically seductive.", "None of this would work at all without the proper actress at \u201cWonder Woman\u2019s\u201d core, and Gadot acquits herself with distinction, expressing power not merely as a display of cool moves and physical derring-do, but quiet focus and almost nonchalant self-possession. Cool, solemn, her eyes often welling with tears at the human waste and destruction she witnesses, Gadot\u2019s Diana is the very opposite of a cartoon character: She\u2019s soulful and utterly credible, even when she comes out bracelets blazing, effortlessly scaling a tower that might have imprisoned a princess like her in another story, at least until the right hero came along.", "var _informq = _informq || []; _informq.push([\"embed\"]); ", "As a young woman just coming into her superhuman powers, Gadot finds the right balance between doelike naivete and determination.

Although Viard exerts an inescapable charm as a wily, attractive epicure, his character\u2019s passive-aggressive bossiness begins to feel more than a little sexist \u2013 and creepy.

There are moments when Coppola\u2019s autobiography gives way to outright nepotism: It\u2019s surely no accident that her son-in-law\u2019s band, Phoenix, is prominently featured on the soundtrack. But during another interlude, when one of the characters brings up a lost son, the filmmaker\u2019s real-life story echoes with genuine poignancy.", "\u201cParis Can Wait\u201d is a modest, genteel piece of cinematic escapism, a silky testament to sensuality as impeccably tasteful as it is utterly undemanding.

The Jannat Guest House, as it\u2019s called, also serves as a locus for all the fantastical side stories that Roy spins in this great tempest of a novel \u2013 from the man who awakens from each epileptic seizure with a different personality to the friend who dreams of emulating Saddam Hussein. Anjum turns no one away and neither does Roy.", "So invested in this colorful graveyard community do we become that it\u2019s something of a shock \u2014 in a book of shocks \u2014 to find ourselves suddenly in what feels like another novel altogether. The second half of \u201cThe Ministry of Utmost Happiness\u201d introduces a new set of characters and encompasses a much wider canvas to capture the ongoing struggle for Kashmir independence.", "In a demonstration of Roy\u2019s tonal range, this section begins in the ironic voice of an Indian government official named Garson Hobart. For years, Garson has been struggling to uphold his country\u2019s militant objectives while also maintaining his friendship with some radicalized friends from college. \u201cIt gives me great pride to be a servant to the Government of India,\u201d he tells us, but the labor of constantly rationalizing his nation\u2019s atrocities has driven him to alcohol and close to a nervous breakdown. \u201cNormality in our part of the world is a bit like a boiled egg. Its humdrum surface conceals at its heart a yolk of egregious violence,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as the center holds, as long as the yolk doesn\u2019t run, we\u2019ll be fine. In moments of crisis, it helps to take the long view.\u201d", "In that same cool voice, Garson goes on to describe India\u2019s counterterrorism endeavors, a program without scruples, sowing confusion everywhere and ignoring the most grotesque human rights abuses in the name of bringing peace to Kashmir. \u201cIt made for the perfect war,\u201d he notes, \u201ca war that can never be won or lost, a war without end\u201d \u2013 a statement that will resonate even with Americans who know nothing of the Indian-Kashmiri conflict.", "Garson\u2019s pickled cynicism gives way to raw suffering when Roy plunges us into the lives of his old college friends: Musa, now a Kashmiri freedom fighter of almost mystical status, and Tilo, the woman he loves. Theirs is a harrowing tale of life on the razor\u2019s edge, knitting together false identities, slipping between torturers\u2019 bloody fingers and struggling to maintain a decency commensurate to their cause. \u201cThis is the worst part of the Occupation,\u201d Musa tells Tilo, \u201cwhat it makes us do to ourselves.\u201d", "Admittedly, Roy sometimes sacrifices coherence in favor of her story\u2019s hurtling movement. The two halves of this novel do eventually connect, but if you have a low tolerance for confusion, loose ends and delayed explanations, you may find this kaleidoscopic story brings the utmost unhappiness. Anyone willing to grab hold, though, will be dazzled by the indefatigable narrative, which is punctuated by transcripts, text messages and newspaper articles \u2013 a cacophony of witnesses and perpetrators, victims and liars in a land where \u201cnightmares were promiscuous\u201d and \u201ctombstones grew out of the ground like young children\u2019s teeth.\u201d", "Roy\u2019s views on the plight of Kashmir are well known and, among some parties, controversial. A few years ago, she co-authored a collection of essays called \u201cKashmir: The Case for Freedom,\u201d in which she wrote, \u201cThe Indian military occupation of Kashmir makes monsters of us all.\u201d Such statements have raised the ire of her political opponents in India and will certainly influence the reception of her new novel. Readers with a different attitude about Kashmir\u2019s rightful status will disagree, but \u201cThe Ministry of Utmost Happiness\u201d never descends into polemics, no matter how broad its sympathies. It\u2019s a thoroughly absorbing work of art \u2013 distinct from Roy\u2019s political statements \u2013 a hybrid of satire, romance, thriller and history. It speaks to the universal struggle of minority people to be free and the all too common corruption of governments determined to maintain control.", "Late in the novel, Musa, the Kashmiri freedom fighter, can\u2019t forget the murder of a young taxi driver, just one of countless innocent people casually snuffed out in this perpetual conflict. \u201cThat story had always stayed with him,\u201d Roy writes, \u201cperhaps because of the way hope and grief were woven together in it, so tightly, so inextricably.\u201d", "So too with this vast novel, which will leave you awed by the heat of its anger and the depth of its compassion."], "pubdate": ["Thu, 01 Jun 2017 01:58:41 +0000"], "title": ["From Arundhati Roy, \u201cThe Ministry of Utmost Happiness\u201d is a remarkable creation"]},

The main subject of the novel, however, is Benjamin\u2019s 10-year-old son, Jonah, who is autistic and mute. \u201cHis mind,\u201d the father says memorably of Jonah, \u201cis like a dictionary with the pages glued together.\u201d", "As heart-rending as mutism in severe autism is, it often arrives with the particularly cruel backstory of a child who speaks somewhat normally in the first year or two of life and then gradually, mysteriously relinquishes language until disappearing entirely into silence.

No matter the good intentions of the parents or how self-sacrificing their desire to keep their child at home, adolescence, with its onrush of agitating hormones, tends to make home care an impossibility. In the case of Jonah, he\u2019s still in diapers at age 10, and on an average day, he paints the walls with his feces, burgles the fridge for food that he then flings around the house, bites his father and takes the majority of his rage out on himself.", "Yet as disabled as Jonah is, he may not, it turns out, be autistic enough.

Emma loves their child no less, but as a lawyer and a highly organized careerist, she is simply less available.", "Their response to the quandary of where to place their child is to pretend to divorce, in the belief that Jonah will be more readily taken by the expensive facility if his home life seems to depend on a single parent (why this would convince a judge to make such a choice is never made exactly clear). To that end, Ben and Jonah move out of their home and take up with Ben\u2019s elderly father. The portrait of the father, a cantankerous yet loving Hungarian Jewish refugee from World War II, is one of the surprise pleasures of the book.

Years earlier, Lady posed for her sister-in-law for a now famous series of photos. She\u2019s both embarrassed and proud of her sexy appearance in a picture known as \u201cWoman No. 17,\u201d and the novel\u2019s consideration of that image offers an unsettling reflection on parenting, the world\u2019s most image-conscious role. Beneath the slick surface of Lady\u2019s sardonic banter, it\u2019s clear that she isn\u2019t a bad mother \u2014 or she isn\u2019t just a bad mother \u2014 she\u2019s a woman who desperately loves her sons but feels agonizingly inadequate.", "Lepucki complicates Lady\u2019s anxiety deliciously by introducing a second, alternating narrator with her own very different mother issues. Esther, an art student who was never quite avant-garde enough for her fellow art students, answers Lady\u2019s ad for a nanny and announces that she\u2019d like to be called \u201cS.\u201d She quickly bonds with little Devin, and it\u2019s pretty clear there will eventually be some late-night bonding with silent Seth. But what she doesn\u2019t disclose is that she\u2019s in the process of creating a bizarre art project: a performance piece that involves re-enacting her own alcoholic mother\u2019s life, bottle by bottle.", "Her secret maternal imitation makes a striking contrast to Lady\u2019s life, which has been one long effort to avoid resembling her own mother. But there\u2019s nothing schematic or predictable about the host of mother problems slinking around these pages. Although none of these characters knows the whole story, every one of them \u2014 even 2-year-old Devin \u2014 knows something illicit that the others don\u2019t. The disclosures that Lepucki engineers in this smart novel are sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious, always irresistible."], "pubdate": ["Fri, 26 May 2017 06:23:36 +0000"], "title": ["\u201cWoman No. 17\u201d a juice box of suburban satire"]},

No one needs a horse to get around these days; most don\u2019t even need a car anymore. But there remains a sense that things aren\u2019t completely decided. An entrepreneur can still make a claim, like, say, inventing a new industry around cannabis or fracking, and all of the opportunities of the West seem available once again. Denver, at the center of it all, still defines itself as it goes along.", "So does its foremost art museum, which has morphed and expanded along with the metropolis it calls home, and which is now assuming even more terrain with the exhibit \u201cThe Western: An Epic in Art and Film.\u201d The show, which runs through Sept. 10, is enlightening and entertaining, and something between pop culture and fine art.", "But make no mistake, this is a major move on DAM\u2019s part, a 21st-century land grab that, if successful, seals its reputation as the pre-eminent Western art institution in the United States.", "DAM \u2014 ambitiously \u2014 redefines and broadens the whole of idea of what is \u201cWestern,\u201d connecting in one display the Western paintings of Frederic Remington and Thomas Moran; the Western literature of Owen Wister and William Cullen Bryant; the Western photography of Carleton Watkins; the Western entertainment of Buffalo Bill; the Western films of John Ford and Sergio Leone; and the neo-Western art of Ed Ruscha, Andy Warhol and Kent Monkman.", "That is a long and diverse list, and to proclaim that all of those distinct genres are actually one thing is radical in its way. But this show builds a strong case for a new and holistic way of thinking about Western art, making links, appropriately for an art museum, through visuals. Curators Thomas Brent Smith and Mary Dailey Desmarais track the invention of Western images by the early painters and writers and then prove how they influenced the history and movements that came after them.", "The lessons are thorough but they\u2019re not hard. Just the opposite. Mainly because the evidence is presented via John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and the actual, red, white and blue motorcycle from \u201cEasy Rider,\u201d and through some of the most colorful, easy to look at paintings and illustrations ever made.", "When the exhibit announces the birth of the Western visual myth, it treats us to Albert Bierstadt\u2019s grand and glowing 1867 oil painting \u201cEmigrants Crossing the Plains,\u201d depicting a wagon train trekking before a glorious set of rocky peaks at sunset.", "When it introduces us to iconic characters and dramas of the story, it presents Alexander Phimister Proctor\u2019s precision-bronze\u00a0sculpture \u201clndian Warrior,\u201d and oil paintings, like Charles Marion Russell\u2019s action-packed 1899 robbery scene \u201cThe Hold-Up,\u201d and Charles Schreyvogel\u2019s \u201cBreaking Through the Line,\u201d which has\u00a0a Calvary soldier on horseback aiming his pistol directly at the viewer.", "When it wants to link us to literature, it has, set in glass cases, major artifacts, like early printings of George Catlin\u2019s illustrated \u201cLetters and Notes\u201d on Indian customs from 1832.", "And when the exhibit demonstrates how these scenic ideas became movies, it shows off with excerpts of cinematic wonders, such as Edwin S.

It bounces around a bit for expediency, but that lets it cover a lot of ground, and it allows for keen, convincing comparisons at several points when it directly juxtaposes two different art forms right next to each other so viewers can see what is borrowed. That happens spectacularly at the very entrance where Remington\u2019s 1889 \u201cA Dash for Timber\u201d painting of cowboys on horseback stands next to a sampler reel of Western movies that stole its scenery over the next century. And it happens stunningly halfway through when it places a large, Franz Kline abstract canvas, \u201cPalladio,\u201d\u00a0next to a still from John Ford\u2019s film\u00a0 \u201cThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\u201d What does a prototypical abstractionist painting have in common with a satirical Western? Both were made in 1961, both in black-and-white, and both show how, post-World War II, notions of art turned cynical, irreverent and self-obsessed.", "\u201cThe Western\u201d is the kind of exhibit you spend time with, hours even, mostly because there are lots of film clips to sit through, and they\u2019re all compelling. The excerpts are edited down to key moments of gunfights, train robberies, field battles and bare-fisted brawls.\u00a0It\u2019s hard to turn away.", "Displaying so much film is a departure for DAM, but serves as an effective way to get to the artfulness of pieces of pop culture that aren\u2019t always taken seriously.

His cinematic moves are elevated here but, it turns out, not artificially.", "The exhibit is less kind to the overall nature of Western art in general.\u00a0 From the earliest works here, like Catlin\u2019s 1932 painting of an Indian chief, to the later looks at regional icons such as Calamity Jane, the art of the West seems trumped up and reduced for effect. It looks imagined and made-to-sell, whether the product is the art itself, the magazines and books it appeared in,\u00a0or the idea of Westward expansion.", "In nearly every painting and sculpture, the scenery is too perfect and the views are conveniently packaged to enhance their romantic nature; we know now that most of the West was actually flat and dusty and kind of boring. The European characters look like heroes, when actually they were Indian killers, and the Indians look like those condescending \u201cnoble savages\u201d or like a pitiful, vanquished lot \u2014 which they were not.", "The question the show raises is: Was Western art ever honest?\u00a0 Or was it always propaganda?\u00a0 Was Western life and history ever captured for anything other than its exotic qualities or to sell commercial and political ideas? The stuff could be beautiful, technically amazing and journalistic, but was it ever really art?", "This show allows for a lot of conclusions on the part of the viewer, many negative, and that is reinforced in the final section of the exhibit, which focuses on contemporary art and film. All of the works here\u00a0carry on the tradition of depicting landscape, cowboys and Indians, but nearly all of them call out the earlier Western art for its exaggerations, fabrications, sexism, racism, homophobia, nationalism and various other crimes against nature.", "What are we to make of a piece like Gail Tremblay\u2019s 2012 sculpture \u201cIt Was Never About Playing Cowboys and Indians,\u201d which weaves actual 16mm film into a sort of patterned American Indian basket? Or Kent Monkman\u2019s \u201cBoudoir de Berdashe,\u201d which turns a teepee into a boudoir for a fictional and exaggerated Native American drag queen, complete with mock, vintage Western films with homoerotic overtones?

The answer, according to this exhibit, appears to be yes \u2014 because it skipped a meaningful incorporation of later Western artists who work with the same vistas without dwelling in full parody,\u00a0a spectrum that started with Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Ansel Adams. It is either this exhibit\u2019s greatest strength \u2014 that it admits and accepts that baloney is at the heart of the Western genre \u2014 or its greatest weakness, undermining the concept that all of this material, strung together, is great American art.", "That makes it a must-see, despite the fact that there is an extra (and anti-visitor) fee\u00a0to see it.", "This is a landmark show, not just because of the questions it raises, but also because it\u2019s never been done to this degree.

When we started Meow Wolf in 2008, (it was) right around same time Rhinoceropolis started and we were friends with the founders, so we had a connection to that for awhile. Denver right now is an incredibly vibrant creative community and, of course, it\u2019s been both energized by the movement of more youth and more millennials into the city, and it\u2019s also starting to be damaged by that growth. From what I\u2019ve experienced in meeting with the creative community of Denver there is a not just a real vibrancy, but a lot of sensitivity and a lot of negative narrative. Some people are upset and scared and angry by (the city\u2019s recent actions).", "Q: Did visiting Breckenridge in May (to speak at the Downtown Colorado Inc. and Colorado Creative Industries annual conventions) give you a more statewide perspective?", "A: Totally. I actually engaged a lot with representatives of rural and smaller Colorado creative communities. Colorado has this amazing infrastructure around the creative sector and has identified it as a piece of economic development, rather than what we have in New Mexico, which is cultural affairs. I think that\u2019s a really important and amazing distinction to witness. It\u2019s not about arts. It\u2019s about creative industry and creative economy, and that\u2019s progressive.\u00a0The coordination between a lot of the different districts in the creative economy was incredible to see.", "Q: On the other hand, what concerned you?", "A:\u00a0The things make me nervous are that the real spark of creativity happens in less-planned environments, and empty or chaotic environments. So my talk was largely based on that: letting all the people in the room who have done an incredible job of organizing and planning and centralizing and connecting know about it, but also to leave space for spontaneity. To me, that spontaneity is in a lot of ways embodied by the DIY arts and music venues, and if we over-plan how we do creative industry, then the people who are in those venues are going to be left behind. It\u2019s really important to recognize alternative spaces as being the genesis of creative vibrancy. Those can\u2019t get forgotten, lost, go unsupported or get homogenized.", "Q: To some extent, the Denver population and development boom echoes\u00a0what happened in Austin, Texas, and Portland, Ore., more than a decade ago, albeit with a less pronounced hipster element. What can we learn from those cities?", "A:\u00a0Austin is the perfect example of a creative community that is kind of on the other side of this (gentrification) arc, where there was a gritty, true kind of low-to-the-ground source of creativity happening and then everybody gets excited about that and the industry and planning and extraction of that source starts to happen. Places become hip, places become popular and then in that process those sources of creativity are left behind, and you\u2019re left with a city that is not nearly as weird or creative as it markets itself to be. That\u2019s what I would be afraid of for Denver. Everybody knows Denver as this cultural hot-spot right now and there\u2019s a reason why. It\u2019s important to support those who are bringing that true creativity.", "Q: Do you feel like New Mexico has anything to learn from Colorado?", "A:\u00a0New Mexico has a lot to learn from Colorado. As I mentioned, we think about art and the creative sector from a vantage point of nonprofits and cultural preservation and cultural affairs, and not economic drivers. Meow Wolf came about it from a completely different perspective and said, \u201cNow, this is going to be an economic driver,\u201d and it\u2019s been really successful. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity when you come at it that way.", "Q: You partnered with Denver Art & Venues this spring to hand out money to Denver DIY arts organizations. Can you go into that a little?", "A:\u00a0So really, all $54,000 is coming from us. Arts & Venues funded us $20,000 with the intent of us rolling it back into what we (distributed), so we took their $20,000 and made decisions with that in mind. They didn\u2019t provide the money directly to the recipients, and it was easier for us to be able to fund, sponsor or support entities that want to remain anonymous and that are wrapped up in some of these issues with their spaces. \u00a0Arts & Venues really wanted to be able to get money into the hands of venues that are at the most risk, but the Catch-22 there was that by funding them, they would have been exposing venues that are at the most risk. So it was just a funny thing. We figured out a way to do it that was safe for everyone.", "Q: Who received the money?", "A: The nine entities that approved being public are Fusion Factory, Fitch Foundation, Moon Magnet Collective, Denver Art Society, 7th Circle, Inca Church, Clown Cake, Pandemic Collective and Recreative Denver. There are five that I have not heard from from yet, and five that definitely want to remain anonymous.", "Q: What was the criteria for getting it?", "A: The criteria was longevity. We definitely wanted to support venues that had been doing it for awhile. It had to be a collective, not just one-person space, but really being supportive of other people. We wanted to support spaces that might have difficulty finding funds from more traditional sources. A couple thousand dollars is a big deal to some of these organizations. And there was no dictation on how it was to be used.", "Q: You\u2019ve reportedly visited Denver several times to meet with developers and landlords for another Meow Wolf location \u2014 which will be much bigger than the Santa Fe one.

The Nationals, now desperate for late-inning relief help, wanted him too. But none of them could guarantee a closer\u2019s role.

And if he pitches in 50 games, or finishes 30, a mutual player option kicks in for 2018 at $15 million.", "He is well on his way to reaching those benchmarks.

Heading into the weekend Colorado\u2019s bullpen had a 4.14 ERA, ranking 17th in baseball, a noticeable spike from recent seasons when the Rockies\u2019 \u2018pen was the worst in the league. \u201cIn the past, we blew a lot of games at the end,\u201d Gonzalez said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a big boost to know that a pitcher of that quality and reliability is coming in,\u201d Black said. \u201cOver time, when you win games after you have leads, it just gives the group a great deal of confidence. It sets up the guys in front of him to have that same level of confidence.\u201d", "The Rockies finished 12 games below .500 last season, in third place in the National League West.

Tebow has been part of this country\u2019s sporting conversation for more than a decade, and he has been, at various points, savior and exile, star and also-ran. And now we\u2019re here, in western Maryland on a hazy and hot Sunday, where Tebow is somehow becoming polarizing all over again.", "He\u2019s a Heisman Trophy winner, a former NFL quarterback, an established football analyst for ESPN.", "Should he be playing baseball? He\u2019s seven years older than any other outfielder for the Columbia Fireflies. He\u2019s not a real prospect, not at his age, not in the South Atlantic League, where most kids are a year or two removed from the draft, not a year or two removed from the Jets.", "Let\u2019s put that aside for a minute. It\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s something significant going on here.", "\u201cWhen he first went to Florida, there really wasn\u2019t anyone great to look up to as far as an athlete,\u201d said John Marcius, a 20-year-old from suburban Pittsburgh who drove 2 1 / 2 hours for a one-night, two-game tribute to Tebow.", "Marcius wore a No. 15 Florida jersey Sunday. His girlfriend, Kayla Schehr, wore a Denver Broncos T-shirt with Tebow\u2019s 15 on the back. In Hagerstown, at a baseball game, they fit right in.", "When Tebow began playing for the Gators as a change-of-pace quarterback in the fall of 2006, Marcius was an impressionable kid looking for a role model. Tebow proved worthy. Marcius admired his faith. He admired his commitment to charity and the less fortunate. He admired the way he interacted with people. He spoke Sunday so easily and passionately about the subject, even the cynical would have believed Marcius when he said, \u201cHe\u2019s really made a difference in my life.\u201d", "Quick example: Marcius got Tebow\u2019s autograph Saturday.", "\u201cI could try to go get another one today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know Tim Tebow wouldn\u2019t think it was right.

When the Fireflies\u2019 parent club, the New York Mets, announced that Tebow would begin his first professional baseball season in Columbia, the Hagerstown Suns, low-Class A affiliate of the Washington Nationals, looked at their schedule, saw their four-game set against to start June and put out on social media that Tebow likely would be here then.", "Within 12 hours, they had sold 800 tickets for each of the four games over this weekend.", "\u201cWe\u2019re all ready for some sleep,\u201d said Travis Painter, the Suns\u2019 general manager, who was still at the ballpark at 3:30 a.m. following Saturday\u2019s game, then back Sunday morning to do it again.", "Painter\u2019s staff is normally just seven or eight people, and a cleaning crew of two cleans the entire stadium after most home games. But the crowd for Suns-Fireflies on Thursday wasn\u2019t driven just by the \u201cThirsty Thursday\u201d beer discounts. No, 6,217 came for Tebow. Doesn\u2019t seem like much, really, until you consider before Tebow arrived the Suns were drawing less than a thousand a night. The total of 22,578 fans set a record for a four-game series at this yard \u2014 which is 87 years old. He is almost certainly the first South Atlantic Leaguer with a media policy \u2014 he speaks once per series on the road, and that happened Friday. The demands on his time are real.", "\u201cHe\u2019s a winner wherever he goes,\u201d said Bowman, decked out in a University of Florida baseball cap and an orange University of Florida fishing shirt. \u201cAnd everywhere he\u2019s gone since Florida, it\u2019s always a circus.\u201d", "The circus, for Tebow, has to be stripped away if this grand experiment is to take hold athletically. He came into Sunday\u2019s game hitting .219 with three homers and 52 strikeouts in 160 at-bats. A left-handed hitter, he has struggled with left-handed pitching, not a surprise given his last full baseball season was in 2005.", "But whatever the stats, this season has to be about becoming familiar with \u2014 and embracing \u2014 baseball\u2019s rhythms. So there was Tebow in the shade of a batting cage more than 90 minutes before first pitch, taking flips from a coach behind a screen, hitting in a group with Reed Gamache, Jay Jabs and Gene Cone. No other Heisman Trophy winner had his name scrawled in chalk \u2014 hitting eighth, playing left \u2014 on a lineup board outside a minor league concession stand. And no other Heisman Trophy worked on this particular craft on this particular day.", "Because people will want to know how he did, we will note it here: He bunted the first pitch he saw from Hagerstown lefty Tyler Watson and was thrown out at first. He fouled off a couple of Watson curveballs in his next at-bat before striking out on a foul tip into the mitt. He walked in his third plate appearance, and in the eighth, with the bases loaded, he laid off tough 1-2 and 2-2 pitches to draw a walk, driving in a run.", "That part won\u2019t matter, though, nor will the Fireflies\u2019 5-3 victory. When the game ended, Tebow signed autographs for those fans clamoring for him behind home plate. But a Mets staffer and his own security detail eventually coaxed him out to right field, toward the clubhouses. There stood a few dozen participants in Tebow\u2019s \u201cNight to Shine\u201d program, a prom experience for kids with special needs put on through Tebow\u2019s foundation.", "When Tebow arrived, he embraced anyone who approached. He called people by name. He took a picture with one kid, spun 180 degrees to take a picture with another, spun back and smiled for the next frame.

Cleveland took every opportunity it could to slow the games down and make them as physical as possible for Golden State, as the Cavaliers hoped they could keep each game close into its final minutes and then let LeBron James and Kyrie Irving \u2013 two of the NBA\u2019s best isolation scorers \u2013 try to take over and carry them to victories.", "It was a formula that proved successful, and allowed Cleveland to climb back from that deficit \u2013 including winning twice here at Oracle Arena \u2013 to stun Golden State and claim the city\u2019s first championship in over a half-century. But as the Cavaliers woke up Friday morning and tried to process what happened in the 113-91 beatdown they suffered at the hands of the Warriors in Game 1 of this year\u2019s NBA Finals Thursday night, they found themselves in a difficult position: The one strategy they know has worked against Golden State in the past is also one Cleveland is unable to go to again.", "\u201cWe made a lot of mistakes,\u201d LeBron James said after Thursday\u2019s loss. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing [that] really needs to be said.", "\u201cWe know we\u2019re capable of playing a lot better.

The Cavaliers committed 20 turnovers \u2013 James himself had eight of them \u2013 and, despite the Warriors playing tremendous defense, missed their fair share of open looks throughout the game.", "But with the roster the Cavaliers have put together over the last year, they don\u2019t look like a team capable of winning games by grinding their opponent into submission, like they had so much success doing as last year\u2019s Finals went on. Instead, they now feel like a group equipped to try to take down the Warriors in a shootout, rather than knock them out in a slugfest.", "And, as Game 1 showed, trying to take down Golden State in a shootout is a daunting task against a team with as much firepower as the Warriors possess.", "\u201cThey\u2019re tough at home,\u201d Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue. \u201cWe know that. They probably lost eight games over the course of three seasons.

Then, when Cleveland reacted to a Durant drive later in the game, he kicked out to Stephen Curry for a wide-open 3-pointer \u2013 one that he calmly buried.", "It underscores the difficulty of the proposition facing Cleveland now. The Cavaliers have to find a way to slow down this Warriors team, but has few weapons to actually do it. Irving and Kevin Love are both minuses defensively, and can be exploited at will. It was no coincidence that a concussion suffered by Love, relegating him to a lesser role when he returned, allowed Cleveland to build a much stronger defense as the series progressed.", "Meanwhile, Cleveland\u2019s bench is filled with pieces like Deron Williams, Kyle Korver and Channing Frye \u2013 all talented players capable of knocking down several 3-pointers, but who also are, to varying degrees, liabilities at the defensive end. That will make it difficult for the Cavaliers to try to turn these games into the kind of physical battles they likely need them to be to make this series competitive \u2013 or, even more simply, to even find a way to routinely guard the Warriors, who seemed to be able to overwhelm the Cavaliers\u2019 porous defense almost no matter what combination of players was on the court in Game 1.", "If the Cavaliers want any chance of making this competitive, though, they\u2019ll have to figure out something, as they got run off the court in this one despite the Warriors getting nothing once again from Klay Thompson (3-for-16 overall and 0-for-5 from 3-point range) and shooting poorly overall as a team (42.5 percent overall and 36.4 percent from 3). The lack of force Cleveland displayed on that end was not only evident in the number of wide-open looks the Cavaliers gave up, but also in that they had no steals and Golden State committed only four turnovers, tying an NBA Finals record.", "\u201cFirst of all, we got to stop the ball in transition,\u201d James said. \u201cThere was a few times where we fanned out to the 3-point line and let guys just go right down the middle for a dunk.", "\u201cSo when you turn the ball over, you got to know that that\u2019s their best. That\u2019s when they become very dangerous because those guys, they sprint down the lane, they sprint to the 3-point line, they put a lot of pressure on your defense.\u201d", "Golden State put a lot of pressure on everything Cleveland did Thursday night, and it didn\u2019t take long for the cracks to show. Now the Cavaliers have two days to try to figure out a way to change the narrative here, and to find a way to even this series at a game apiece going back to Cleveland next week, as opposed to finding itself heading home down 2-0 to the Warriors for a second straight season.", "But as the Cavaliers attempt to figure out what changes they can make, only one thing seems certain: last year\u2019s blueprint doesn\u2019t seem to be workable with this year\u2019s team. And, given that playing that way still seems to be the best chance Cleveland has of winning this series, that is a serious problem."], "pubdate": ["Fri, 02 Jun 2017 16:36:35 +0000"], "title": ["Cavaliers found a blueprint to beat Warriors last year.

While depression may be more common among girls, other conditions are more common among boys, such as conduct problems, aggression and substance abuse. One way of explaining this pattern involves a possible single underlying phenomenon, with different people branching off to develop different disorders because of social influences. There\u2019s also the possibility it may be connected to biological differences, perhaps involving changes in hormones or other ways that are distinct to how girls are socialized.", "Breslau said the researchers initially hoped the data would be able to provide insights into how to differentiate between high-risk and low-risk cases of depression, but they were not able to answer that question. The findings showed that children who have had recent depression and those who had depression a while ago are very similar to each other in terms of school function and likelihood of suicide. But clearly not all will go on to develop serious problems.", "Study author Elizabeth Miller, director of the division of adolescent medicine at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, said that until researchers can get a better understanding of why some people can come out of depression without intervention while others need help, teachers and others who work with children should learn to recognize the signs of childhood depression.

Those talks could include broad spending increases for domestic and military programs that break from Trump\u2019s plan for deep cuts in education, housing, research and health care.", "\u201cI think that\u2019s the only way,\u201d Cornyn said of working with Democrats on spending. \u201cIt would be good to get that done so we can get the Appropriations Committee to get to work.\u201d", "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said such spending talks would be inevitable.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to negotiate the top line with Senate Democrats, we know that,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \u201cThey will not be irrelevant in the process and at some point, here in the near future, those discussions will begin.\u201d", "As Senate Republicans were discussing a bipartisan spending agreement, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney stood across town pitching Trump\u2019s proposal to dramatically alter the role of government in society, shrinking the federal workforce, scaling back anti-poverty programs and cutting spending on things like disease research and job training. The $4.094 trillion proposal for fiscal year 2018 includes $1 trillion in cuts over 10 years to anti-poverty programs including Medicaid, food assistance and health insurance for low-income children.", "It would slightly increase spending on the military, immigration control and border security and provide an additional $200 billion for infrastructure projects over 10 years. It would also allocate $1.6 billion for the creation of a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.", "Budget experts questioned many of the economic assumptions that the White House put into its plan, saying it was preposterous to claim that massive tax cuts and spending reductions will lead to a surge in economic growth. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, for example, said that using normal economic projections, the White House\u2019s proposal would not eliminate the deficit and would allow U.S. debt to continue growing into the next decade.", "\u201cRather than making unrealistic assumptions, the president must make the hard tax and spending choices needed to truly bring the national debt under control,\u201d it said.", "The White House proposals represent a defiant blueprint for a government realignment that closely follows proposals made in recent years by some of the most conservative members of the House, a group that once included Mulvaney himself. Trump has alleged that safety net programs create a welfare state that pull people out of the workforce, and his budget would cull these programs back.", "Mulvaney pointed specifically to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the modern version of food stamps. The White House plans to propose forcing states to pay a portion of the benefits in the program, which reached more than 44 million beneficiaries in 2016.", "\u201cWe are not kicking anybody off of any program who really needs it,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cWe have plenty of money in this country to take care of the people who need help. . . . We don\u2019t have enough money to take care of . . . everybody who doesn\u2019t need help.\u201d", "Mulvaney, who served in the House from 2011 until earlier this year, is a co-founder of the Freedom Caucus. Many of the provisions in Trump\u2019s first budget reflect long-standing priorities of the Republican Party\u2019s far right in cutting back federal spending to get the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal picture under control \u2013 largely by cutting entitlement programs that mainly benefit the poor.", "Republicans are keenly interested in passing a budget this year because they hope to use that legislation to lay the groundwork for a GOP-friendly rewrite of the tax code. Many GOP members hope to attach the tax reform to the budget process in order to advantage of special Senate rules that would allow both the budget and tax rewrite to pass with 51 votes, rather than the 60 that are needed to pass most other legislation. That special treatment could be critical to the success of the GOP tax effort in the Senate, where Republicans control a slim 52-to-48 majority.", "White House officials knew their budget proposal would be jarring and launch a political fight, but they think it is a necessary debate given a wing of the Republican Party that wants the government to shrink.", "But the cuts were met with intense criticism even among the majority of GOP members who hailed Trump\u2019s desire to pare back spending, including many who worried about the size of some of the proposed cuts.", "Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.), chairman of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, said he was encouraged by early reports of new curbs on food stamps, family welfare and other spending. But he said he draws the line on cuts to Meals on Wheels, a charity that Mulvaney earlier this year suggested was ineffective.", "\u201cI\u2019ve delivered meals to a lot of people that perhaps it\u2019s their only hot meal of the day,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be some give and take, but to throw out the entire budget just because you disagree with some of the principles would be inappropriate.\u201d", "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he backs Trump\u2019s proposal for a temporary burst of new defense spending, which White House officials say would allow them to add 56,400 service members in 2018. But he worries that Trump would finance those increases by cutting critical programs like the National Institutes of Health.", "\u201cMy number one goal is to have a more balanced budget,\u201d said Graham, who also endorsed the idea of entering into spending talks with Democrats. \u201cNIH is a national treasure, and it would be hurt, too.\u201d", "Graham is part of a long-standing alliance between defense hawks who want increased military spending and Democrats who are willing to back military programs in exchange for more spending on domestic priorities. The two sides have forged several past agreements, including a two-year plan for increased spending that is set to expire at the end of September.", "Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said that formal spending discussions have not yet begun but he is prepared to work with GOP leaders when the time is right.", "\u201cThe idea that we\u2019ll work on a bipartisan budget independent from the president\u2019s is ripe in the air,\u201d Schumer said.", "But such a deal is sure to anger conservatives in the House, where many of the most hard-line members staunchly defended aspects of Trump\u2019s proposal.", "Although Meadows said Meals on Wheels cuts might be \u201ca bridge too far,\u201d he praised much of the rest of the Trump budget. \u201cIt probably is the most conservative budget that we\u2019ve had under Republican or Democrat administrations in decades,\u201d he said.", "Rep. Scott DesJarlais (Tenn.), a Freedom Caucus member, rejected the argument that Trump\u2019s budget represented a betrayal of some of his populist campaign promises, notably to protect Medicaid spending.", "\u201cIf we don\u2019t do something to protect the program for the people who really need it, then they\u2019re not going to have access to that, so I think we can\u2019t continue to ignore these big-ticket items,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to get our budget to balance and pay down our debt, we\u2019re going to have to make these tough choices and have these tough votes.\u201d", "\u00a0"], "pubdate": ["Wed, 24 May 2017 06:31:42 +0000"], "title": ["Even some Republicans balk at Trump\u2019s plan for steep budget cuts"]},

So, even as apparel makers crank out more U.S.-made shirts and shoes, the industry is losing more jobs than it\u2019s creating.

They nicknamed the place the \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d", "Yet it seemed the federal government had another vision, Carter-King said. In January 2016, President Barack Obama issued a moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal exploration that was a direct hit to Gillette, where most mining was done on federal land. The environmental regulations that had helped propel the industry were now stifling it.", "Carter-King said Obama\u2019s antipathy toward fossil fuels stripped the city of the ability to develop more environmentally friendly ways to burn coal, prevented leaders from researching different uses for the material and complicated efforts to export the city\u2019s prized possession to China and other fast-growing markets.", "Then came a warm 2015 winter, which led to less need for fuel. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen low oil and gas prices and low coal prices all at once,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then we had a president who didn\u2019t want to help us.

When we started Meow Wolf in 2008, (it was) right around same time Rhinoceropolis started and we were friends with the founders, so we had a connection to that for awhile. Denver right now is an incredibly vibrant creative community and, of course, it\u2019s been both energized by the movement of more youth and more millennials into the city, and it\u2019s also starting to be damaged by that growth. From what I\u2019ve experienced in meeting with the creative community of Denver there is a not just a real vibrancy, but a lot of sensitivity and a lot of negative narrative. Some people are upset and scared and angry by (the city\u2019s recent actions).", "Q: Did visiting Breckenridge in May (to speak at the Downtown Colorado Inc. and Colorado Creative Industries annual conventions) give you a more statewide perspective?", "A: Totally. I actually engaged a lot with representatives of rural and smaller Colorado creative communities. Colorado has this amazing infrastructure around the creative sector and has identified it as a piece of economic development, rather than what we have in New Mexico, which is cultural affairs. I think that\u2019s a really important and amazing distinction to witness. It\u2019s not about arts. It\u2019s about creative industry and creative economy, and that\u2019s progressive.\u00a0The coordination between a lot of the different districts in the creative economy was incredible to see.", "Q: On the other hand, what concerned you?", "A:\u00a0The things make me nervous are that the real spark of creativity happens in less-planned environments, and empty or chaotic environments. So my talk was largely based on that: letting all the people in the room who have done an incredible job of organizing and planning and centralizing and connecting know about it, but also to leave space for spontaneity. To me, that spontaneity is in a lot of ways embodied by the DIY arts and music venues, and if we over-plan how we do creative industry, then the people who are in those venues are going to be left behind. It\u2019s really important to recognize alternative spaces as being the genesis of creative vibrancy. Those can\u2019t get forgotten, lost, go unsupported or get homogenized.", "Q: To some extent, the Denver population and development boom echoes\u00a0what happened in Austin, Texas, and Portland, Ore., more than a decade ago, albeit with a less pronounced hipster element. What can we learn from those cities?", "A:\u00a0Austin is the perfect example of a creative community that is kind of on the other side of this (gentrification) arc, where there was a gritty, true kind of low-to-the-ground source of creativity happening and then everybody gets excited about that and the industry and planning and extraction of that source starts to happen. Places become hip, places become popular and then in that process those sources of creativity are left behind, and you\u2019re left with a city that is not nearly as weird or creative as it markets itself to be. That\u2019s what I would be afraid of for Denver. Everybody knows Denver as this cultural hot-spot right now and there\u2019s a reason why. It\u2019s important to support those who are bringing that true creativity.", "Q: Do you feel like New Mexico has anything to learn from Colorado?", "A:\u00a0New Mexico has a lot to learn from Colorado. As I mentioned, we think about art and the creative sector from a vantage point of nonprofits and cultural preservation and cultural affairs, and not economic drivers. Meow Wolf came about it from a completely different perspective and said, \u201cNow, this is going to be an economic driver,\u201d and it\u2019s been really successful. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity when you come at it that way.", "Q: You partnered with Denver Art & Venues this spring to hand out money to Denver DIY arts organizations. Can you go into that a little?", "A:\u00a0So really, all $54,000 is coming from us. Arts & Venues funded us $20,000 with the intent of us rolling it back into what we (distributed), so we took their $20,000 and made decisions with that in mind. They didn\u2019t provide the money directly to the recipients, and it was easier for us to be able to fund, sponsor or support entities that want to remain anonymous and that are wrapped up in some of these issues with their spaces. \u00a0Arts & Venues really wanted to be able to get money into the hands of venues that are at the most risk, but the Catch-22 there was that by funding them, they would have been exposing venues that are at the most risk. So it was just a funny thing. We figured out a way to do it that was safe for everyone.", "Q: Who received the money?", "A: The nine entities that approved being public are Fusion Factory, Fitch Foundation, Moon Magnet Collective, Denver Art Society, 7th Circle, Inca Church, Clown Cake, Pandemic Collective and Recreative Denver. There are five that I have not heard from from yet, and five that definitely want to remain anonymous.", "Q: What was the criteria for getting it?", "A: The criteria was longevity. We definitely wanted to support venues that had been doing it for awhile. It had to be a collective, not just one-person space, but really being supportive of other people. We wanted to support spaces that might have difficulty finding funds from more traditional sources. A couple thousand dollars is a big deal to some of these organizations. And there was no dictation on how it was to be used.", "Q: You\u2019ve reportedly visited Denver several times to meet with developers and landlords for another Meow Wolf location \u2014 which will be much bigger than the Santa Fe one. What can you say about that?", "A: We have a few locations that we have identified, a couple of really strong possibilities, and we\u2019re just trying to work out a deal.

The first was sincerity, which is a form of truthfulness. The second, and this is not unrelated to the first, was a kind of sweetness. You always came away liking his subjects for their flaws. Not in spite of them. For them.", "The funny thing was, Frank didn\u2019t write about people who were easy to like. Jimmy Connors. Bobby Knight. Bill Russell. They defied idolizing. Frank picked them on purpose, I think, because he understood that sports are stories we tell ourselves about who we would like to be \u2014 but aren\u2019t. Games are not stories on the level of Hollywood, or best-selling novels; there is a crucial difference: What happens on the field is real, authentic in a way no movie can be, with real people committing real acts. Athletes are ordinary beings with the same flaws as the rest of us, and like all of us, they frequently fail. They fail, they curse, they snarl, and they fail ethics tests, too. They are not the perfect representations of virtue we\u2019d like them to be. This is where all the trouble starts. And that was right where Frank Deford went, and started digging in.", "He took on a long profile of Connors when the tennis great was mired in a terrible psychological slump, having lost six of seven majors, and pressed a finger on him: Connors was \u201cswollen with vitriol and tension.\u201d Yet by the time he got done with Connors, you understood him a little, because you\u2019d glimpsed his lurking charm and vulnerability, and how unsparing his mother, Gloria, had been with him, whapping the ball at his head, saying, \u201cYou see, Jimbo, you see what even your own mother will do to you on a tennis court?\u201d", "He meticulously dismantled Knight\u2019s temper as if he were a bomb disposal expert, picking at his wires with tweezers. Knight was \u201cstill a prodigy in search of proportion,\u201d Frank explained. The excesses and the mouth that used \u201cbad language like a weapon\u201d came with an astringent honesty and unrelenting standards. He introduced you to Knight\u2019s father, a man of such old-world strictness that he took out a 20-year mortgage and paid it off in four. Knight was a \u201csubstance guy in a style word,\u201d and the juxtaposition was what made him so irascible.", "Frank\u2019s work taught the aspiring sportswriters who grew up on him that games are stories about who we really are \u2014 and to forget that was to be in danger of drifting into cliche and template and myth, and those weren\u2019t nearly as affecting or moving as the truth. That tension between truth and myth was in all of Frank\u2019s work, but especially in his novel \u201cEverybody\u2019s All-American,\u201d which became a superb film about the graying of an adored football hero into just a man with a gut. Frank was OK with that graying \u2014 he found incredible dignity in it. There was a whisper under all of Frank\u2019s work that if we demand too much myth instead of truth, pretty soon we start liking and not liking people for all the wrong reasons.", "Who are athletes really, and do they have qualities that are actually worth admiring? He asked that question in every story, and in every one, the answer he arrived at was emphatically yes \u2014 just not in way you thought.", "To me the most meaningful and complicated if not the best story Frank ever wrote was about the German heavyweight Max Schmeling. He was an Aryan poster boy for the Nazis, who had enjoyed the attentions of Hitler and admitted he had knowledge of the camps. Yet he had also refused to join the party and tried to aid Jews. Frank\u2019s piece portrayed Schmeling in all his aging complexity, his mixture of pride and sin of omission, expedience in the face of evil, and his tangled sense of moral responsibility.", "Frank wrote: \u201cMost Americans of a certain age know for an absolute fact that, long ago, Max Schmeling was the dirty rotten Nazi who got lucky and beat Joe Louis, but then got his comeuppance when our good Joe demolished him in the rematch \u2014 sticking it to Hitler in the bargain. Schmeling, though, was never a Nazi. He was sometimes credulous and sometimes weak and often an example of what the road to hell is paved with.\u201d", "Frank interviewed the widowed old man in his country house eating potato pancakes, and told us about how Schmeling had stood by his Jewish trainer despite threats from Joseph Goebbels, and during Kristallnacht, Schmeling had hidden two Jewish teenaged boys, Henry and Werner Lewin, for four days and tried to help them to safety. \u201cI was only doing the duty of a man,\u201d Schmeling said. He was only \u201csomewhat\u201d proud of his actions.", "\u201cSomewhat,\u201d Frank wrote, pressing that finger of his down again. \u201c. . . It is such an honest, tempered word. It signals to us, more than anything, that you had to have been present when the Third Reich was aborning and then thriving and then crumbling. Then you never would be so sure again. There would always be a somewhat in your life.\u201d", "We all have our somewhats, Frank suggested in the piece. An athlete may give his all in the ring, and do a heroic thing out of it, yet also be a half-hearted soldier of the Wehrmacht who had for a time accepted favors from Hitler. Remember that. The heroes and the villains are never simple.", "\u201cAn honest tempered word.\u201d The phrase equally applied to Frank; that was exactly how he wrote.

There\u2019s still value in the license that\u2019s attached to a piece of real estate.

There was oil and gas in the city, too, and a place whose best-known landmark was literally once a pile of rocks turned into an American boomtown.", "Strip malls and highways and schools and a Rockpile Museum were built, and over time the population swelled from a few thousand to 30,000. In 2016, the median income in mining was about $78,000.", "The problem with being a one-industry town is that the economy lives and dies on how the market performs.

If oil and gas production was down, that would generally mean companies were buying coal. If coal prices were too low, jobs in oil and gas provided some relief.", "The last great boom came with the advent of fracking in the mid-2000s. Although most of the country reeled from a recession, officials in Gillette were recruiting workers from job-starved Michigan. Developers carved out subdivisions on the southern end of the city. The county and school district built a gleaming, elaborate recreation center, complete with indoor tennis courts, modern gym equipment and a 42-foot rock-climbing wall in the shape of nearby Devil\u2019s Tower, a national monument.", "So confident was the city in its growth potential that officials spent $2.5 million to purchase 320 acres of barren land from the state. Leaders encouraged residents to think beyond their wildest imaginations about what could be done with it. They built four softball fields and drafted plans for a water park. They nicknamed the place the \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d", "Yet it seemed the federal government had another vision, Carter-King said. In January 2016, President Barack Obama issued a moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal exploration that was a direct hit to Gillette, where most mining was done on federal land. The environmental regulations that had helped propel the industry were now stifling it.", "Carter-King said Obama\u2019s antipathy toward fossil fuels stripped the city of the ability to develop more environmentally friendly ways to burn coal, prevented leaders from researching different uses for the material and complicated efforts to export the city\u2019s prized possession to China and other fast-growing markets.", "Then came a warm 2015 winter, which led to less need for fuel. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen low oil and gas prices and low coal prices all at once,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then we had a president who didn\u2019t want to help us. It was a perfect storm for things to get downright depressing.\u201d", "By all accounts, it did. After the warm winter, Arch Coal and Peabody Energy laid off close to 500 people in two of the area\u2019s 12 mines in March 2016. Coal production dropped by 34 percent during the first half of 2016, according to state data and news reports, and the state lost nearly $300 million in tax revenue.", "This downturn didn\u2019t seem like the ones they once knew.

Many seethed at \u201cthe environmentalists.\u201d", "\u201cI love to fish and hike and hunt,\u201d Gorton said. \u201cWhy would I work in an industry that would hurt my family? I try to avoid all the politics and look at the facts.

Residents started spending less and the city\u2019s sales tax revenue plummeted 40 percent. Nearly one in 10 people were unemployed.", "The city cut 10 percent of its staff, and plans for the water park were indefinitely tabled. There would be no more development on the Field of Dreams.", "Five months after Gorton returned to work, he was sitting at Pizza Carrello with his co-workers and boss.", "\u201cA round of jalepeno poppers!\u201d Coleman demanded as the place buzzed.

She moved here from small-town Montana and achieved her dream of opening a restaurant, one of the biggest in the city. She made some history here, too. In 2014, she and her co-owner Rachel Kalenberg became the first same-sex couple in the county to get a marriage license. They were nervous about how a conservative city would respond to them and their business.", "Her customers responded by heading to the restaurant armed with cards and balloons. That was the Gillette she loved. Now she worried that, with its revival, it may be fading.", "As Trump rose to the presidency, Jimison said more customers mocked her sexual orientation. Someone recently etched \u201cBull Dike Queers\u201d in one of the restaurant\u2019s wooden tables. She wondered whether Trump\u2019s rhetoric excavated a hate that lingered as close to the surface as the coal.", "\u201cYou have so much support here,\u201d Coleman told her. \u201cNo one here cares if you\u2019re LGBT, or a woman \u2013 I mean, person \u2013 owning a business. And everyone is more positive now that things are better.\u201d", "\u201cBut there are people still hurting,\u201d Jimison said. One of them was the man pouring their beer. He made $39 an hour as a land surveyor, if only someone had the need for his services. A local furniture shop and clothing store were closing downtown, and the city had lost a Sears and Sports Authority. The arts community and social service agencies were all losing money.", "In Gillette, the new American optimism was tenuous and shaky. It was bedrocked on that age-old patriotism, preached from its leaders, that it was never a good idea to bet against the ingenuity of the American intellect, nor the industriousness of the American worker.", "Gorton considered himself one of those industrious American workers. When he was laid off, he considered brewing beer or learning a trade or even moving out of the state for a more stable life. But that seemed like he was betting against himself.", "\u201cWhat choice do we have but to be optimistic?\u201d Gorton said, almost embarrassed to invoke the president\u2019s trademarked phrase. \u201d I just have to believe that Gillette will be great again.\u201d", "\u201cWithout coal, Wyoming is over,\u201d said a man sitting next to him, as he gripped his beer with oil-stained fingertips.

Kathy\u2019s father, an illiterate laborer, had gone on disability after damaging an arm while working on a manhole. Franny went on it next.

When we started Meow Wolf in 2008, (it was) right around same time Rhinoceropolis started and we were friends with the founders, so we had a connection to that for awhile. Denver right now is an incredibly vibrant creative community and, of course, it\u2019s been both energized by the movement of more youth and more millennials into the city, and it\u2019s also starting to be damaged by that growth. From what I\u2019ve experienced in meeting with the creative community of Denver there is a not just a real vibrancy, but a lot of sensitivity and a lot of negative narrative. Some people are upset and scared and angry by (the city\u2019s recent actions).", "Q: Did visiting Breckenridge in May (to speak at the Downtown Colorado Inc. and Colorado Creative Industries annual conventions) give you a more statewide perspective?", "A: Totally. I actually engaged a lot with representatives of rural and smaller Colorado creative communities. Colorado has this amazing infrastructure around the creative sector and has identified it as a piece of economic development, rather than what we have in New Mexico, which is cultural affairs. I think that\u2019s a really important and amazing distinction to witness. It\u2019s not about arts. It\u2019s about creative industry and creative economy, and that\u2019s progressive.\u00a0The coordination between a lot of the different districts in the creative economy was incredible to see.", "Q: On the other hand, what concerned you?", "A:\u00a0The things make me nervous are that the real spark of creativity happens in less-planned environments, and empty or chaotic environments. So my talk was largely based on that: letting all the people in the room who have done an incredible job of organizing and planning and centralizing and connecting know about it, but also to leave space for spontaneity. To me, that spontaneity is in a lot of ways embodied by the DIY arts and music venues, and if we over-plan how we do creative industry, then the people who are in those venues are going to be left behind. It\u2019s really important to recognize alternative spaces as being the genesis of creative vibrancy. Those can\u2019t get forgotten, lost, go unsupported or get homogenized.", "Q: To some extent, the Denver population and development boom echoes\u00a0what happened in Austin, Texas, and Portland, Ore., more than a decade ago, albeit with a less pronounced hipster element. What can we learn from those cities?", "A:\u00a0Austin is the perfect example of a creative community that is kind of on the other side of this (gentrification) arc, where there was a gritty, true kind of low-to-the-ground source of creativity happening and then everybody gets excited about that and the industry and planning and extraction of that source starts to happen. Places become hip, places become popular and then in that process those sources of creativity are left behind, and you\u2019re left with a city that is not nearly as weird or creative as it markets itself to be. That\u2019s what I would be afraid of for Denver. Everybody knows Denver as this cultural hot-spot right now and there\u2019s a reason why. It\u2019s important to support those who are bringing that true creativity.", "Q: Do you feel like New Mexico has anything to learn from Colorado?", "A:\u00a0New Mexico has a lot to learn from Colorado. As I mentioned, we think about art and the creative sector from a vantage point of nonprofits and cultural preservation and cultural affairs, and not economic drivers. Meow Wolf came about it from a completely different perspective and said, \u201cNow, this is going to be an economic driver,\u201d and it\u2019s been really successful. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity when you come at it that way.", "Q: You partnered with Denver Art & Venues this spring to hand out money to Denver DIY arts organizations. Can you go into that a little?", "A:\u00a0So really, all $54,000 is coming from us. Arts & Venues funded us $20,000 with the intent of us rolling it back into what we (distributed), so we took their $20,000 and made decisions with that in mind. They didn\u2019t provide the money directly to the recipients, and it was easier for us to be able to fund, sponsor or support entities that want to remain anonymous and that are wrapped up in some of these issues with their spaces. \u00a0Arts & Venues really wanted to be able to get money into the hands of venues that are at the most risk, but the Catch-22 there was that by funding them, they would have been exposing venues that are at the most risk. So it was just a funny thing. We figured out a way to do it that was safe for everyone.", "Q: Who received the money?", "A: The nine entities that approved being public are Fusion Factory, Fitch Foundation, Moon Magnet Collective, Denver Art Society, 7th Circle, Inca Church, Clown Cake, Pandemic Collective and Recreative Denver. There are five that I have not heard from from yet, and five that definitely want to remain anonymous.", "Q: What was the criteria for getting it?", "A: The criteria was longevity. We definitely wanted to support venues that had been doing it for awhile. It had to be a collective, not just one-person space, but really being supportive of other people. We wanted to support spaces that might have difficulty finding funds from more traditional sources. A couple thousand dollars is a big deal to some of these organizations. And there was no dictation on how it was to be used.", "Q: You\u2019ve reportedly visited Denver several times to meet with developers and landlords for another Meow Wolf location \u2014 which will be much bigger than the Santa Fe one. What can you say about that?", "A: We have a few locations that we have identified, a couple of really strong possibilities, and we\u2019re just trying to work out a deal. That\u2019s pretty much all we can say.", "Q: And you expect to announce it this summer?", "A: That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to do."], "pubdate": ["Sun, 04 Jun 2017 06:20:22 +0000"], "title": ["Founder of Meow Wolf, Santa Fe\u2019s acclaimed art playground, talks about its future in Denver\u2019s scene"]},

We\u2019ll be able to do that.. . . So far we see positive signs in the marketplace. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to approach it.\u201d", "But then it didn\u2019t happen. The owners, who must ratify such a change, simply seemed to lose interest. And the measure, it appears, generates very little discussion these days among league leaders and the owners.", "That doesn\u2019t mean the idea has been discarded for good, however. It has been put aside, for sure. But it could be revisited in the next round of deliberations over the league\u2019s television contracts and its collective bargaining agreement.", "The entire conversation goes back to the last set of labor negotiations leading up to the 2011 CBA. The owners, remember, proposed an 18-game regular season with a reduced preseason. The players vehemently objected to a longer regular season and the owners dropped the proposal. They said they never would lengthen the regular season without the players\u2019 approval.", "But the owners did not drop the idea of shortening the preseason. Needing a way to boost revenues to offset the loss of revenues associated with a reduced preseason, the owners turned to an expanded postseason field, with a couple extra playoff games to sell to the TV networks.", "Under the proposed measure, seven teams in each conference would qualify for the playoffs instead of six. There would be only one team per conference given an opening-round postseason bye instead of two. So there would be six first-round playoff games leaguewide instead of four. One of them probably would be played on a Monday night.", "But there were (and are) issues. There were concerns about watering down the playoff field by allowing 44 percent of the league into the postseason rather than the current 38 percent. There also is a potential conflict between the prospective Monday night first-round playoff game and the college football playoffs.", "Does that mean it will never happen? No, it doesn\u2019t mean that.", "At some point, the NFL calendar will be revisited. The preseason still could be shortened. A longer regular season, either 17 or 18 games, could be reconsidered, although the players\u2019 approval remains the obvious obstacle there. So the expanded postseason could end up being reexamined as the revenue-boosting alternative. The current labor deal runs through 2020, and it makes sense to sort all of this out as the CBA and the next set of TV contracts are being hammered out.", "1. Seahawks say no to Kaepernick. . . So the Seattle Seahawks have taken a pass, at least for now, on signing Colin Kaepernick as their backup quarterback. That means their main alternative to Russell Wilson is Trevone Boykin. They\u2019d better hope their offensive line is much better than it has been or that Wilson remains as elusive and fortunate as he has been.", "2. Next for Kaepernick?. . . It now becomes a waiting game for Kaepernick. Teams are into their offseason programs and there is no catalyst, it seems, to prompt a signing sooner rather than later. It now appears likely that it will be at least into training camp before a team reconsiders its quarterback options and Kaepernick becomes an alternative somewhere.", "3. What about RG3?. . . If Kaepernick can\u2019t get a job, are there any prospects for Robert Griffin III? Could a team justify passing up Kaepernick, coming off a 16-touchdown, four-interception season in San Francisco, in favor of Griffin, coming off a two-touchdown, three-interception season in Cleveland?", "Of course, teams justified signing quarterbacks such as Blaine Gabbert and Ryan Fitzpatrick instead of Kaepernick. So perhaps signing Griffin wouldn\u2019t be too much of a stretch.", "4. Seahawks\u2019 strife. . . The Seahawks have done their best to try to dismiss the report by ESPN The Magazine about internal strife stemming from cornerback Richard Sherman\u2018s inability to let go of the ill-fated play call on the goal line that led to Wilson\u2019s Super Bowl-losing interception against the New England Patriots. Fine. It probably won\u2019t be an issue if the Seahawks have a successful season. But if things don\u2019t go so well, it won\u2019t be as easy for them to put this aside.", "5. Ravens\u2019 OTA injuries. . . Injuries obviously are part of football. But nothing is worse than injuries occurring in offseason practices. The Baltimore Ravens have been particularly hard hit this offseason with the torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered by cornerback Tavon Young and the hip injury, reportedly career threatening, suffered by tight end Dennis Pitta. Little to nothing is won in the NFL during the offseason. But plenty can be lost.", "6. Offseason restrictions. . . Keep such injuries in mind the next time NFL coaches talk about the need to roll back some of the restrictions on offseason practices put in place in the last labor deal. The NFL Players Association is very, very unlikely to agree to any rollbacks of those restrictions.", "7. On Norman. . . Josh Norman\u2019s recent comments to Bleacher Report about Dez Bryant and Odell Beckham Jr. were relatively tame, by his standards. Norman can say what he wants. But, really, has he played well enough since moving from the Carolina Panthers to the Washington Redskins to justify such inflammatory remarks? Not really taking a stand on that.
