 takes as an input a term-document matrix and generates a set of topics that represent weighted sets of
 co-occurring terms. The discovered topics form a basis that provides an efficient representation of
 the original documents.

 finds coourring terms and groups the documents based on the co-occurring terms.  These
 groups form the simplified topics which best represent the articles as a
 whole.

NMF groups terms based on a linear combination of one another.  This differs from LDA which I also
tried, which assumes a probablitistic approach to topic modeling.  NMF provided a better fit to my
data.

NMF is based on the assumption that the set of articles has a small set of hidden features.  NMF
generates these features by finding cooccuring terms and weighting them to form simplifited groups
representing the hidden features.
