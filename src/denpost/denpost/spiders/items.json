When we started Meow Wolf in 2008, (it was) right around same time Rhinoceropolis started and we were friends with the founders, so we had a connection to that for awhile. Denver right now is an incredibly vibrant creative community and, of course, it\u2019s been both energized by the movement of more youth and more millennials into the city, and it\u2019s also starting to be damaged by that growth.

So my talk was largely based on that: letting all the people in the room who have done an incredible job of organizing and planning and centralizing and connecting know about it, but also to leave space for spontaneity. To me, that spontaneity is in a lot of ways embodied by the DIY arts and music venues, and if we over-plan how we do creative industry, then the people who are in those venues are going to be left behind.

Places become hip, places become popular and then in that process those sources of creativity are left behind, and you\u2019re left with a city that is not nearly as weird or creative as it markets itself to be. That\u2019s what I would be afraid of for Denver. Everybody knows Denver as this cultural hot-spot right now and there\u2019s a reason why.

As I mentioned, we think about art and the creative sector from a vantage point of nonprofits and cultural preservation and cultural affairs, and not economic drivers. Meow Wolf came about it from a completely different perspective and said, \u201cNow, this is going to be an economic driver,\u201d and it\u2019s been really successful. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity when you come at it that way.", "Q: You partnered with Denver Art & Venues this spring to hand out money to Denver DIY arts organizations. Can you go into that a little?", "A:\u00a0So really, all $54,000 is coming from us. Arts & Venues funded us $20,000 with the intent of us rolling it back into what we (distributed), so we took their $20,000 and made decisions with that in mind. They didn\u2019t provide the money directly to the recipients, and it was easier for us to be able to fund, sponsor or support entities that want to remain anonymous and that are wrapped up in some of these issues with their spaces. \u00a0Arts & Venues really wanted to be able to get money into the hands of venues that are at the most risk, but the Catch-22 there was that by funding them, they would have been exposing venues that are at the most risk. So it was just a funny thing. We figured out a way to do it that was safe for everyone.", "Q: Who received the money?", "A: The nine entities that approved being public are Fusion Factory, Fitch Foundation, Moon Magnet Collective, Denver Art Society, 7th Circle, Inca Church, Clown Cake, Pandemic Collective and Recreative Denver. There are five that I have not heard from from yet, and five that definitely want to remain anonymous.", "Q: What was the criteria for getting it?", "A: The criteria was longevity. We definitely wanted to support venues that had been doing it for awhile. It had to be a collective, not just one-person space, but really being supportive of other people. We wanted to support spaces that might have difficulty finding funds from more traditional sources. A couple thousand dollars is a big deal to some of these organizations. And there was no dictation on how it was to be used.", "Q: You\u2019ve reportedly visited Denver several times to meet with developers and landlords for another Meow Wolf location \u2014 which will be much bigger than the Santa Fe one. What can you say about that?", "A: We have a few locations that we have identified, a couple of really strong possibilities, and we\u2019re just trying to work out a deal. That\u2019s pretty much all we can say.", "Q: And you expect to announce it this summer?", "A: That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to do."]},
{"article": ["In recent weeks, the story of a New Jersey lawyer whose off-hours political activism was brought to the attention of her employer went viral because of the unusual way it happened: A congressman\u2019s letter flagged her as a \u201cringleader\u201d of a group in New Jersey aimed at making him more accountable and accessible to his constituents. In a fundraising letter sent to a board member of the bank for which Saily Avelenda worked, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., attached an article that quoted her, warning in a handwritten postscript that a member of one of the groups challenging him worked in his bank.", "But the story also raises questions about what rights employees have when it comes to off-duty political activity, particularly in an era of rising political engagement, growing hyper-polarization, and increasing use of social-media platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn that easily connect workers with their employers. Though Avelenda was not disciplined or asked to resign, her boss did have her write a statement about her activities with the group, and she later decided to quit on her own, in part because of the pressure she felt from the episode.", "\u201cI was not using my employer\u2019s name anywhere,\u201d Avelenda said in interview, noting she was careful to not even use pens with a company logo while she was working with the group. The bank, where she was an assistant general counsel, also was not named in media reports where she was quoted, but she believes her unusual name played a role in her being identified.", "\u201cI was stunned why I had to do anything.\u201d (A representative of Avelenda\u2019s employer, Lakeland Bank, did not return a phone message, but in a Facebook post, the bank said it \u201cdoes not comment on the status of our current or former employees\u201d and that its code of ethics allows that \u201ceach employee has the opportunity to support community activities or the political process in the manner that she or he desires.\u201d)", "The answer to those questions is that the rights employees hold depend greatly on the state \u2014 or even the city or county \u2014 where they live. Some states specifically bar companies from firing or disciplining employees for lawful off-hours conduct, or protect certain political activities. Others don\u2019t have those protections: For instance, New Jersey, where Avelenda lived, is not among the states that protect employees for their off-duty political activity, said Debra Katz, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who represents employees in discrimination suits. Nor are Virginia and Maryland, she said, though Howard and Prince George\u2019s counties have passed statutes similar to one in D.C., which does prohibit discrimination based on political party affiliation.", "There is also no federal law that explicitly protects private-sector employees for off-duty political activism, though the National Labor Relations Act gives protection for union-related political activity, Katz says. \u201cRight now it\u2019s so hotly polarized, and social media is creating trails of everything everybody does,\u201d Katz said. \u201cI think people would be aghast to know that those rights are not guaranteed in most states.\u201d", "Another common misunderstanding is that freedom of speech protections offer job protections for nongovernment workers. The First Amendment restricts the government from discriminating against public employees for political speech, and people generally from state censorship or punitive action by the state. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a private employer there\u2019s no particular freedom of speech,\u201d said Lindsay Burke, vice chair of the employment law practice at the firm Covington & Burling. \u201cThere are no particular First Amendment rights with regard to your work\u201d for private employers, she says.", "Eugene Volokh, a law professor and free speech expert, says it\u2019s \u201cfair to say there are about a dozen states in which there is considerable protection for employees, at least off-duty, and maybe sometimes on duty, for political and ideological expression and activism.\u201d States like North Dakota, Colorado, New York and California have relatively broad prohibitions against taking action against an employee who takes part in lawful off-duty political activity, but there are still differences, and exceptions for things related to business interests or job duties, such as journalists being prohibited from volunteering for political campaigns or taking part in political marches.", "Another roughly dozen states protect certain kinds of activity related to the electoral process, Volokh says, such as signing a petition or making contributions to a political campaign, but these are narrower protections. States, he notes, are asking whether political activity should be treated \u201cas things like appearance, or what college you went to, where basically we leave it to the employers\u2019 good sense in the marketplace to prevent discrimination, or do we treat it like race and religion and sex, [where] you can\u2019t discriminate on that even when you might have good business reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cSome states take one view and some states take another.\u201d", "Even where there are protections spelled out for workers, there is not always a lot of case law that helps define the ambiguous terms used in many states, such as what is meant by \u201cpolitical activity\u201d or what might constitute an \u201cessential business-related interest.\u201d", "One reason there may not be many cases, Volokh says, could be that many employers simply \u201ctake a live-and-let-live attitude toward employees\u2019 politics,\u201d believing that interfering with employees\u2019 off-hours time would be bad for morale. In other words, just because some states lack protection doesn\u2019t mean many employers are necessarily acting on it.", "Katz says lawyers she knows who represent management \u201cfeel they have to tread very carefully on monitoring social media,\u201d taking action only when people are doing things like violating trade secrets, confidentiality or actively disparaging their employer.", "Other possible reasons there aren\u2019t many cases, Volokh says, is that the awards aren\u2019t always generous, creating little motivation to deal with the legal hassle, or that employees and employers may not be aware of the statutes. \u201cA lot of these date back to the early 1900s,\u201d he said. And while employees\u2019 political activities may lead to some awkward working relationships, there are not always the kind of tangible actions \u2014 a denied promotion, a termination \u2014 that merit filing a suit.", "Paula Brantner, a senior adviser to Workplace Fairness, a nonprofit focused on employee rights, says that she has typically seen only one or two of these kinds of cases stand out each election cycle, though she expects we could hear about them more often in the future. \u201cA lot of people who haven\u2019t been active before are newly energized and there are a lot of groups forming around the country,\u201d she said. Plus, \u201cwith social media, one\u2019s personal views get amplified far more than they were in the past.\u201d"]},
{"article": ["Take a bow, investors. It\u2019s never been cheaper to invest in funds, and it\u2019s largely because of you.", "Investors are increasingly heeding experts\u2019 advice to seek out lower-cost funds in their 401(k) accounts and other portfolios. And because so much money is massing in the cheapest funds, the pressure is on the rest of the industry to cut their own expenses or risk losing even more dollars. The result of this heightened cost consciousness: Investors are keeping more of their own dollars and possibly setting themselves up for better returns in the future.", "The steady drip lower for expenses means $63 of every $10,000 invested in stock mutual funds went to cover fees last year. That\u2019s down from $67 a year earlier and from $104 two decades ago, according to figures published recently by the Investment Company Institute, an industry group. Bond funds have seen a similar drop in fees: The average cost has dropped to $51 from $84 of every $10,000 invested over the last two decades.", "A separate study released by Morningstar last month\u00a0found the same trend: Investors paid lower expenses last year than ever before for their mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, on average.", "One of the biggest drivers is the exploding popularity of index funds and ETFs, which boast some of the lowest expenses in the industry. Many investors have given up on trying to find star fund managers who can deftly pick the right stocks and bonds to beat the rest of the market. Instead, they\u2019re fine with riding funds that merely track the movements of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 and other indexes.", "Because index funds don\u2019t have to hire teams of stock pickers and other market analysts, and because they\u2019re all trying to do roughly the same thing, these funds typically compete on price, and that price has been inching closer to zero. Schwab and iShares have ETFs that track the broad U.S. stock market with expense ratios of just 0.03 percent, for example. That means $3 of every $10,000 invested goes to cover fees.", "As a group, index funds have an average expense ratio of 0.17 percent, according to Morningstar. Actively managed funds, which are the ones run by managers that are trying to beat the market, have an average expense ratio more than quadruple that, at 0.75 percent.", "Having low expenses is one of the best predictors for a fund\u2019s relative future performance, analysts say. That\u2019s because a fund that charges 0.75 percent has to perform just about that much better to produce the same returns as a fund with a 0.03 percent expense ratio. The cheaper fund begins the race with a built-in head start.", "Investors have noticed, and they pulled $340 billion out of actively managed funds last year. At the same time, nearly $505 billion went into index funds.", "But one small group of actively managed funds is managing to buck the trend: the cheapest ones. Actively managed funds with fees that rank in the cheapest 20 percent attracted $41 billion in net investment over the last two years. The other 80 percent of actively managed funds, meanwhile, saw $627 billion leave over the same time, according to Morningstar.", "It\u2019s a relatively new trend. As recently as 2013, investors were putting money into actively managed funds broadly, not just the cheapest 20 percent. The split has become more pronounced in each of the following three years.", "One warning: Read the label closely when a fund advertises its \u201cbelow-average\u201d fees. That\u2019s because, like much in investing, calculating the average fee can be a complicated affair, and more than half of funds can make the claim.", "If you add up all funds\u2019 expense ratios and divide that by the total number of funds, the simple average expense ratio of all funds was 1.14 percent last year. So anyone with a 1 percent expense ratio could tout having a \u201cbelow-average\u201d fee.", "But because investors have flocked in such droves to cheaper funds, the average expense ratio was only 0.57 percent, if you give more weight to funds with bigger assets. This asset-weighted approach is how the Investment Company Institute, Morningstar and other analysts prefer to look at the market. Less than 10 percent of money invested in funds was in one that had an expense ratio above 1.14 percent.", "So even though following the herd is rarely a good idea in investing, this time really may be different.
