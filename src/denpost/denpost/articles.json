", "Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation Committee, embraced the dormant concept last year and fought to win the approval of his committee. But the bill it passed got no attention on the House floor, and there was muttering on the Senate side that suggested it had no future there.", "\u201cI first spoke to President Trump back in 2014 about the need for reform, and I\u2019m glad to be working on it with him in 2017,\u201d Shuster said. \u201cPresident Reagan, who passed away 13 years ago today, once said \u2018government is not the solution to the problem; government is the problem.\u2019 His words are fitting when we realize that government bureaucracy has held back innovation in American aviation. It\u2019s time to bring our aviation system into the 21st century.\u201d ", "The issue on Capitol Hill has not been the functioning of the 14,000 air traffic controllers, who are universally subject to praise for their devotion to safety when mentioned in the House or Senate committees that oversee them. ", "Instead, Congress has expressed enormous frustration over the pace of the FAA\u2019s modernization program, called NextGen.", "While commonly referred to as a GPS-based system for directing the flow of aircraft, that simplistic explanation is akin to saying it\u2019s the carburetor that makes a car\u2019s wheels go around.", "The reality is that NextGen is a complicated group of systems intended to smooth the flow of airplanes, speed air travel, save fuel and accommodate a 20 percent increase in passengers in the next two decades.", "The current system is radar-based and requires planes to fly from one waypoint to the next rather than in a straight line to their destination. (Complaints about low-flying airliners have been legion across the country as the first of several NextGen projects has come on line.)", "Selling Congress and the airlines, who would bear some of the cost, on a multibillion-dollar modernization program seemed like a dicey proposition, so about a dozen years ago the FAA came up with a catchy name for all its projects: NextGen.", "That gave the FAA a single name to use when it sought money from Congress. But it also gave Congress a single program to hold accountable when elements of NextGen moved slowly, or not at all.", "Congress\u2019s perception that NextGen wasn\u2019t moving fast enough was amply bolstered by critical reports from the inspector general\u2019s office and from the Government Accountability Office.", "The FAA, however, has been able to point to success in recent years with some elements of NextGen.", "When Shuster revived the concept of moving the controllers and the NextGen program to a private nonprofit corporation run by a board of directors, one of the big four airlines \u2013 Delta \u2013 opposed the move and parted company with the lobbying group Airlines for America, which endorsed it. Operators of small planes and corporate jets \u2013 known as \u201cgeneral aviation\u201d to distinguish them from the airlines \u2013 pushed back out of fear the airlines would dominate the corporation\u2019s board.", "That National Air Traffic Controllers Association backed Shuster\u2019s plan, saying the new corporation would ensure more stable funding than Congress could provide, while the 11,000-member Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union strongly opposed it.", "\u201cIt is unfathomable, even dangerous, to consider gambling with the future and safety of our air traffic control system through privatization,\u201d PASS President Mike Perrone said in a statement last month.", "Mirroring much of Shuster\u2019s 2016 proposal, a four-page White House proposal underscores that \u201cno group should have the appearance of influence over the board of directors,\u201d countering the argument that the airlines would dominate the board.", "The new corporation would pay for itself through user fees for airlines and \u201creasonable\u201d fees passed on to passengers, the administration said. It also would have the authority to adjust air routes after seeking public comment, recognizing that NextGen routing will cause noise over houses that haven\u2019t previously experienced low-flying planes.", "The wording of the White House paper may cause concern for union members who would go off the federal payroll. It specifies twice that current employees will retain their pay and benefits and be able to participate in federal retirement and health-care plans. It does not say that the corporation\u2019s new hires should expect the same pay or benefits."]},

Law enforcement agencies charged Teague $702.27 and Rogers $500 for the examinations of their victims.", "Rogers had offered the victim a ride and then forced her to perform a sex act behind a building at knife point. A district judge in his case ruled that the exam did not qualify as an extraordinary cost because law enforcement typically use the tests to gather evidence.", "The Colorado Supreme Court reversed the district court judge\u2019s decision in Rogers\u2019 case, determining that \u201cSexual Assault Nurse Examiner\u201d exams serve dual purposes of collecting forensic evidence but in a \u201cpatient-sensitive\u201d manor unrelated to building a criminal case."]},
