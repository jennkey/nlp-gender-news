Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) and other Democratic lawmakers, as a shared information technology worker.\n\nLittle has been made public by Capitol Police on what exactly is being investigated; news reports in recent months have linked Awan, several of his relatives, and his wife to some type of Capitol Hill investigation that could involve stolen property and more.\n\nThe new scrutiny came after a budget hearing on May 18 with U.S. Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa; the hearing before a House Appropriations subcommittee had escaped notice, until reports earlier this week by the Daily Caller, noting the sharp words that Wasserman Schultz had for Verderosa.\n\nAt the end of her Q&A with the police chief, Wasserman Schultz asks what happens when police find lost items.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to know how Capitol Police handle equipment that belongs to a member, or a staffer, that\u2019s been lost within the Capitol complex, and found or recovered by one of your officers,\u201d Wasserman Schultz begins.\n\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3SmzSQXTY4&w=640&h=390]\n\nThe bottom line from the chief was simple \u2013 until an investigation is completed, \u201cI can\u2019t return the equipment,\u201d which is reportedly a laptop from Wasserman Schultz\u2019s office.\n\nThat answer did not satisfy the Florida Democrat.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re violating the rules when you conduct your business that way,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said bluntly, as she told the chief that he should \u201cexpect that there will be consequences.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of that somewhat jarring verbal exchange, a reporter on Thursday asked House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi about the Awan investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really not familiar with what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been busy with a lot of other things,\u201d Pelosi added.\n\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KgHD0H709c&w=640&h=390]\n\nU.S. Capitol Police have released little information about what this probe involves, and who exactly is being investigated.\n\nAccording to U.S. House spending records, Imran Awan was a shared employee for thirteen different House members in 2016, earning in the third quarter anywhere from as little as $300 from a pair of Democrats to $6,624.99 from another.\n\nAwan\u2019s pay from Wasserman Schultz fell in between those numbers, as he received $5,000.01 per quarter for work in her office in 2016.\n\nAwan\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, worked for seven Democrats, plus the House Democratic Caucus, earning close to $44,000 in the third quarter of 2016.\n\nRecords also show two relatives of Awan\u2019s on the Congressional payroll: Abid Awan worked for eight different House Democrats, while Jamal Awan worked for eight others \u2013 all as \u2018shared\u2019 employees.\n\n]]>', 'source': 'ajc', 'article_url': u'http://jamiedupree.blog.ajc.com/2017/05/27/few-public-answers-to-puzzle-in-congressional-it-investigation/feed/', 'keywords': [u'schultz', u'quarter', u'capitol', u'dupree', u'house', u'puzzle', u'jamie', u'pelosi', u'answers', u'awan', u'chief', u'investigation', u'wasserman', u'shared', u'worked', u'ajc', u'ajcfew', u'public', u'congressional'], 'date_pulled': '06/07/2017'}

Curtis Compton / ccompton@ajc.com\n\nState Rep. Tommy Benton is an unapologetic supporter of Georgia\u2019s Confederate heritage.\n\nHe flatly asserts the Civil War wasn\u2019t fought over slavery, compares Confederate leaders to the Founding Fathers and is profoundly irritated with what he deems a \u201ccultural cleansing\u201d of Southern history. He also said the Ku Klux Klan, while he didn\u2019t agree with all of their methods, \u201cmade a lot of people straighten up.\u201d (Read the AJC\u2019s latest coverage here.)\n\nBenton\u2019s views are why for years he has pushed legislation that would protect the state\u2019s historical monuments from being marred or moved. This year he is stepping up his efforts with two newly introduced measures, one of which seeks to amend the state constitution to permanently protect the carving of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gens. Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson at Stone Mountain.\n\nHouse Resolution 1179, which Benton, R-Jefferson, dropped in the House \u201chopper\u201d Wednesday, assures that the \u201cheroes of the Confederate States of America \u2026 shall never been altered, removed, concealed or obscured in any fashion and shall be preserved and protected for all time as a tribute to the bravery and heroism of the citizens of this state who suffered and died in their cause.\u201d\n\nIt also requires the park around the mountain to be kept as \u201can appropriate and suitable memorial for the Confederacy.\u201d\n\nIf passed, the resolution would go to voters as a statewide referendum before it could be added to the constitution.\n\nBenton also is behind a second bill, House Bill 855, requiring the state to formally recognize Lee\u2019s birthday on Jan. 19 and Confederate Memorial Day on April 26. State employees have long received these as paid vacation days, but this year Gov. Nathan Deal had them listed on state calendars as generic holidays.\n\nBenton said his bills are a direct response to Senate Bill 294, which would forbid the state from formally recognizing holidays in honor of the Confederacy or its leaders. Benton described the bill\u2019s sponsor, Sen. Vincent Fort, as \u201ca fanatic\u201d and the bill\u2019s intent as \u201ccultural terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no better than what ISIS is doing, destroying museums and monuments,\u201d he said in an exclusive interview this week with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cI feel very strongly about this. I think it has gone far enough. There is some idea out there that certain parts of history out there don\u2019t matter anymore and that\u2019s a bunch of bunk.\u201d\n\nFort declined to respond directly to Benton\u2019s characterization of his bill as terrorism.\n\n\u201cFor him to degenerate into that kind of name calling is beneath a response from me,\u201d Fort, D-Atlanta, said. \u201cThat kind of hyperbole does not allow for anything approaching a debate. It\u2019s unfortunate that he would use that language.\u201d\n\nFort defended his bill, saying the state shouldn\u2019t be in the business of formally \u201crecognizing people who were slave owners or fought to protect slavery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. Beginning and end. Slavery was a crime against humanity,\u201d he said.\n\nIf someone wants to privately honor the Confederacy with their own memorial or flags, that\u2019s fine, he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe that taxpayer funds should be used to commemorate people who stole the freedom of other human beings.\u201d\n\nBenton, a retired middle school history teacher, equates Confederate leaders with the American revolutionaries of the 18th century \u2014 fighting a tyrannical government for political independence.\n\n\u201cThe war was not fought over slavery,\u201d he said. Those who disagree \u201ccan believe what they want to,\u201d he said.\n\nThe debate over Confederate symbols is rooted more in present-day concerns, sparked by last summer\u2019s mass shooting of African-American members of a church in Charleston, S.C., by avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof. Roof posted pictures of himself with Confederate flags on social media prior to the shootings, helping to reignite a debate over the public display of such symbols.\n\nIn an interview last summer with the AJC, Benton said he saw the concern over the flag as a distraction from problems within the black community.\n\n\u201cThat flag didn\u2019t\u2019 shoot anybody and when I was growing up I had a couple of those flags. In fact I still have a couple of them. It doesn\u2019t make me a racist,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody said anything about black-on-black crime, and that\u2019s about 98 percent of it. Nobody said anything about family life and who\u2019s in the home and who\u2019s not in the home. It\u2019s always something else that is the problem.\u201d\n\nStone Mountain\u2019s iconic carving has been a target since the Charleston shootings, with the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference both calling for it to be removed. Opponents of the carving cite the fact that the mountain was the site of the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan in 1915 and the Klan held cross burnings at the mountain for decades.\n\nBenton said there are two sides to that story as well. The Klan \u201cwas not so much a racist thing but a vigilante thing to keep law and order,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt made a lot of people straighten up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying what they did was right. It\u2019s just the way things were.\u201d\n\nHe also said that Klan membership shouldn\u2019t be an automatic reason to dispense with a historical figure.\n\n\u201cA great majority of prominent men in the South were members of the Klan,\u201d he said. \u201cShould that affect their reputation to the extent that everything else good that they did was forgotten.\u201d\n\nBenton said Wednesday he stands by those statements. Fort, a history professor, called Benton\u2019s comments \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is acting as an apologist for the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s right about elites like (past governors) of the state of Georgia being in the Klan, but just because it was the elites with the bullwhip doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d\n\nBenton has another bill, House Bill 854, which would require streets named in honor of veterans that have been renamed since 1968 revert back to their original names. That bill has no cosponsors and \u2014 for both political and practical reasons \u2014 is unlikely to get a hearing, but were it to pass it would result in a portion of Martin Luther King Boulevard revert back to its original name, Gordon Road.\n\nGordon Road was named in honor of Gen. John B. Gordon, a highly decorated Confederate officer who later was governor and and a U.S. senator from Georgia and was an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia. A statue of Gordon, in Confederate uniform and astride his horse, occupies a prominent place on the Capitol grounds.\n\nKing is not mentioned in the text of the bill, but the civil rights leader was assassinated in 1968.', 'source': 'ajc', 'article_url': u'http://investigations.blog.ajc.com/2016/01/28/ga-lawmaker-seeks-constitutional-protection-for-stone-mountain-carving/', 'keywords': [u'mountain', u'stone', u'georgia', u'lawmaker', u'klux', u'bill', u'comments', u'state', u'ku', u'confederate', u'klan', u'honor', u'history'], 'date_pulled': '06/07/2017'}

The life of a criminal, we all know, is rough. How rough?\n\nAccording to recent reports, inmates at the minimum-security federal prison camp in southeast Atlanta have to \u201cescape\u201d to use drugs or alcohol and meet women. Not wanting to cause too much trouble, most return to their cells when the party is over.\n\nMuch to the chagrin of the incarcerated, the lackadaisical warden has \u201csuddenly retired.\u201d\n\nFortunately, there are others eager to make life better for the legally challenged.\n\nSnellville police will be at Gwinnett High School June 3 to help people struggling to get a job \u201cclean up\u201d their criminal past.\n\nWhen I was in high school police showed up to scare students straight. I remember deputies dragging some sad fellow in to tell us his life was derailed because of the malevolent forces of marijuana. His acting skills probably got him out of jail early.\n\nNow it seems police go to school to help the people they\u2019ve arrested look like better job candidates.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this presentation is to assist people who may have had youthful indiscretions or other issues resulting in arrests and convictions that inhibit obtaining gainful employment,\u201d Snellville Police Chief Roy Whitehead said in a recent AJC.com story.\n\nDoes anyone else find it odd police want to make the charges they created disappear?\n\nI called Snellville police for an explanation.\n\nLt. Tommy Taylor, who is organizing the Gwinnett High event, said \u201cWe put people in jail to protect the public, but we also try to help individuals to keep them out of the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying [to clear the record of a] bank robber,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cbut this could help someone who might have been charged with possession of marijuana 15 years ago. \u2026 It can help correct little indiscretions so they can get a job and become an upstanding citizen.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cindiscretions\u201d is making the rounds, but it\u2019s a euphemism for \u201ccrimes.\u201d\n\nThe process of cleaning up your criminal record varies by state, but in Georgia the convicted person usually has to get the approval of the agency that prosecuted them. If approved, records kept at the Georgia Bureau of Investigations are \u201crestricted\u201d so background checks by most employers do not show the conviction.\n\nSearches by law enforcement always show a full criminal history, said Taylor.\n\nHelping the formerly incarcerated find employment is quite trendy.\n\nIn 2014, the City of Atlanta adopted a \u201cBan the Box\u201d policy that removed the \u201chave you been convicted\u201d checkbox from city job applications. In 2015, Gov. Nathan Deal approved a similar policy. Twenty-six states and more than 150 cities and counties have now adopted such a measure.\n\n\u201cBan the Box\u201d has a ring to it, but until the \u201cBan the Job Interview\u201d movement happens the feared question still gets asked.\n\nI\u2019m all for helping folks out. I agree that a misdemeanor offense shouldn\u2019t stop someone from getting a job, much less an interview.\n\nBut, if I was an employer or a law-abiding person looking for work, I\u2019d wonder why my tax dollars are being used against me.', 'source': 'ajc', 'article_url': u'http://newstome.blog.ajc.com/2017/05/16/cops-to-help-former-criminals-hide-info-from-employers/', 'keywords': [u'info', u'criminal', u'life', u'criminals', u'hide', u'help', u'snellville', u'indiscretions', u'school', u'employers', u'high', u'cops', u'job', u'taylor', u'work'], 'date_pulled': '06/07/2017'}

In recent notifications, the city had threatened to do that if property owners and artists did not seek certifications under an \u201camnesty provision\u201d under the public art ordinance. Parties were given a June 9 deadline to comply.\n\n\u201cThe city recognizes the importance of public art and artistic expression,\u201d city spokeswoman Jenna Garland said. \u201cThe city has no plans to remove any existing art work on June 9 or any other date.\u201d\n\nThe city is negotiating a settlement of the dispute \u201cin a manner that is favorable to all,\u201d Garland said.\n\nThe federal lawsuit, filed Tuesday, said local artists and property owners were told\n\nto go through an onerous multi-step application process to retain artwork that already exists or face possible prosecution \u2014 and the elimination of murals on their own property.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg had set a hearing for Friday, but postponed it until July 23. According to the court\u2019s docket, both sides had informed the judge \u201cthey had engaged in discussions (regarding) a possible resolution.\u201d\n\nGerry Weber, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, confirmed that his clients and the city are trying to settle the dispute. \u201cAbsent reaching a resolution sometime soon, we will press for an order to make sure all murals in the city are protected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city has sought to find an acceptable way to regulate street art after some neighborhoods complained about murals that had painted on the exterior walls of private and public structures, without anyone\u2019s permission.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the public art ordinance, which has been on the city\u2019s books since 1982, is unconstitutional. The suit notes that, before painting new murals, artists must go through an arduous application process: approval from five separate city offices, including the mayor and the City Council. The public art ordinance also provides no time limits for the approval process, the suit said.\n\nAmong the plaintiffs are Fabian Williams, a street artist who makes\n\nmurals under the name \u201cOccasional Superstar\u201d; Peter Ferrari, \u201cPLF\u201d; Benito Ferro, \u201cYoyo Ferro\u201d; and bar owner Grant Henry.\n\nSince 2010, Atlanta has become a city well-known for its street and mural arts, said\n\nMonica Campana, executive director of Living Walls, the Atlanta nonprofit that promotes street art.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have seen beautiful public art appear all over our city; and I have experienced collaboration, solidarity and community engagement with artists and residents,\u201d said Campana, who is not involved in the litigation.\n\n\u201cThe current public art ordinance is limiting,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I am confident that if artists and the city work together, we could figure out ways to both maintain creative freedom and support a shared vision of a robust public art scene in Atlanta.\u201d', 'source': 'ajc', 'article_url': u'http://legal.blog.ajc.com/2017/06/02/city-street-artists-trying-to-resolve-dispute/', 'keywords': [u'city', u'settle', u'art', u'ordinance', u'remove', u'existing', u'process', u'tries', u'street', u'murals', u'artists', u'atlanta', u'lawsuit', u'public', u'dispute'], 'date_pulled': '06/07/2017'}

The route selected will displace 279 homes and 96 businesses. (Dwight Adams/IndyStar) Wochit\n\nThe IFA issued a statement from Director Dan Huge on Monday, but it also did not address the issue of cost and where the money will come from. Huge has declined numerous interview requests.\n\nCherian George, managing director of the Fitch ratings agency, earlier told IndyStar that if a project is terminated for cause, the cost of completion typically would rise.\n\n"As a result, there will be additional cost, because now the state has to take it back and actually deliver the project and fill in the gaps," George said. "It may be more than they thought they were going to pay, but it may not be an exorbitantly higher amount."\n\nThere will also be money available from the project\'s performance bond \u2014 insurance that it will be completed. But the state only required a bond covering 25 percent of the project\'s value,which bond analysts said was on the low end of what would typically be required. And getting money from that bond could also be held up by litigation.\n\nWhat\'s more, the winning bid was $73 million lower than the next lowest bid, suggesting other contractors might demand more.\n\nThe project was originally touted by the state as an innovative public-private partnership that would take advantage of private sector expertise, innovation and efficiency to save taxpayers money.\n\nI-69 Development Partners won a bid to design, construct and maintain the highway for decades after completion. But in March the Spanish company Isolux Corsan \u2014 which initially comprised more than 80 percent of I-69 Development Partners \u2014 entered insolvency proceedings in Spain.\n\nIt had four months to reach an agreement with creditors and avoid potential bankruptcy.\n\nThe state\'s negotiations to buy out the bonds for the project have been unsuccessful so far, but Huge\'s statement said "the state is moving forward with the goal of assuming control." The state has not, however, declared the developer to be in default.\n\nWhen asked about the deal, I-69 Development Partners issued the following statement: "I-69 Development Partners and the IFA continue to participate in confidential discussions with the aim of ensuring the successful completion of the project. We are confident that we can reach an agreement with the IFA."\n\nRep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, said the protracted construction has not only frustrated people but also created safety issues.\n\n"I think they should have been willing to declare the company in default a long time ago," he said.\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb spoke to reporters about the project on Monday in Evansville, again not mentioning added costs.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that work will continue during these negotiations and we have made it crystal clear that finishing I-69, Section 5 and finishing the complete I-69 is a top priority with my administration,\u201d Holcomb said.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Mark Alesia at (317) 444-6311.

The condition can be concentrated on one part of the body, or spread over much of it.\n\nLowes said she kept her condition secret for years. Recently, however, she decided to step out publicly.\n\nShe has partnered with PsoriasisInsideStory.com, a forum of personal essays from people coping with psoriasis, part of a campaign launched by pharmaceutical company Janssen Biotech Inc. and the National Psoriasis Foundation.\n\n"If there are over 7 million people who are struggling with this disease \u2014 and various levels of it \u2014 we wanted to find for them a way to use their voice, and to share the treatments that are working for them," said Lowes.\n\nWith her condition now largely under control, Lowes shares what has helped her, and how stress can be the biggest trigger.\n\nHow did you find out you had the condition?\n\nIt was a really big year in my life. I was newly engaged. I got \u201cScandal\u201d and that was far and away the biggest deal that had happened in my career. Simultaneously, the stress from planning my wedding, and being in the public eye for the first time, combined with genetics -- I got the diagnosis that I had psoriasis, and I was completely embarrassed and ashamed. I felt like a lesser person.\n\nHe lost 85 pounds in four months \u2014 and kept it off \xbb\n\nWhat were your symptoms?\n\nAt first, it was irritated skin at the base of my neck. And then it started to get bad -- itchy and red. I tried every over-the-counter thing I could. Different shampoos and lotions. I refused to wear my hair up or wear dresses with low-cut backs. And then I realized that I was starting to make these choices without getting to the bottom of what was really going on.\n\nI got the diagnosis that I had psoriasis, and I was completely embarrassed and ashamed. I felt like a lesser person. \u2014 Katie Lowes\n\nHow did you cope with it in Hollywood where it\'s so much about how you look?\n\nI\'m lucky in that I have a more moderate case, and I could get away with hiding it. But it affected how I felt on the red carpet. I had to have some photos taken for our save-the-date card and had a horrible flare-up of flaking and irritated skin, painful on my neck and back. I had nothing to wear that looked good. I looked bad on the outside and I felt bad on the inside and I called off the shoot. That was the moment I said to myself: "I\'m canceling these life moments because of this. I need to be my own best advocate."\n\nWhat have you learned about preventing flare-ups?\n\nI still have to be very careful. The weather, food, the environment \u2014 they\'re all triggers. I have to not let my skin get dry. If I spend a week on vacation indulging in a bunch of sugar, my body reacts. Stress is a huge part of it. I\'m big on yoga, and of taking care of my mental health. I do Hatha yoga at Yogaworks three times a week, and do two hikes a week. I did a lot of research about nutrition, and the anti-inflammatory stuff works for me: Being very light on sugar, alcohol and dairy, eating clean, sticking to a ton of vegetables and proteins.\n\nAnd all that has been effective for you?\n\nThe condition is very much under control. I\'ve found a doctor, treatment and lifestyle that work for me. I run into so many people who also have psoriasis and share the same feelings as I had. I tell them that it\'s about being your own boss, and of not settling until they find whatever it is that works for them, and they have their life look the way they want it to.\n\n93209892 Here, Nick Hardwick explains how his 4-2-3-1 diet plan helped him lose 85 pounds in 4 months.', 'source': 'latimes', 'article_url': u'http://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-katie-lowes-battles-psoriasis-20170511-htmlstory.html#nt=barker&bn=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It', 'keywords': [u'psoriasis', u'scandals', u'life', u'lowes', u'felt', u'stress', u'red', u'hid', u'wear', u'skin', u'week', u'condition', u'katie'], 'date_pulled': '06/07/2017'}

Haley, 33, looks down at his bold print and erupts into laughter.\n\n\u201cAnything Sam doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d he explains, \u201che\u2019ll just go, \u2018Brooklyn.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe actor and director make for quite the study in contrasts. Elliott, known for his reliable white mustache, gives off the air of an urbane cowboy. He tends toward solid colors and appreciates a good pair of boots, even though he lives in Malibu. His speech \u2014 uttered in a slow drawl so low it\u2019s sometimes difficult to hear \u2014 is sparse, but deliberate.\n\nHaley, meanwhile \u2014 who does in fact take up in Brooklyn\u2019s Cobble Hill \u2014 looks like he could be Elliott\u2019s hipster grandson. He wears chunky glasses and has a full beard. He has so much energy that it seems possible he\u2019s secretly hooked up to a caffeine drip.\n\nAnd yet over the past couple of years, the two have grown so close that Elliott begrudgingly admits he now sends Haley text messages that end with heart emojis.\n\n(Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIt\u2019s a friendship that began in 2014, when the filmmaker cast Elliott as Blythe Danner\u2019s character\u2019s love interest in his film \u201cI\u2019ll See You in My Dreams.\u201d They forged such a bond during the experience that Haley decided to create a star vehicle for Elliott: \u201cThe Hero,\u201d out Friday, which is already earning the veteran performer some of the best reviews of his career.\n\nIn many ways, it\u2019s obvious that \u201cThe Hero\u201d was written for Elliott, because the film contains a number of parallels to the actor\u2019s own life. The movie is about an aging western star named Lee Hayden whose glory days are behind him. While he\u2019s still beloved by fans of westerns, he\u2019s no longer able to land big roles and makes ends meet by doing voice-over work for barbecue sauce commercials.\n\nSam Elliott (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n\nElliott, of course, is in a far better place career-wise \u2014 in part, thanks to Haley. But the Sacramento native did make a name for himself as a western star \u2014 playing a grizzled cowboy in films like \u201cTombstone,\u201d \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d and countless made-for-television movies. Ever since \u201cI\u2019ll See You in My Dreams,\u201d however, there\u2019s been an Elliott renaissance of sorts. He was cast as a lead on Ashton Kutcher\u2019s Netflix series \u201cThe Ranch\u201d and also landed a recurring role on the streaming service\u2019s \u201cGrace and Frankie.\u201d This summer, he\u2019s been busy filming a part in Bradley Cooper\u2019s \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d remake with Lady Gaga.\n\nBut \u201cThe Hero\u201d is different: A story tailored to him in which he appears in nearly every scene.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s gotta be every actor\u2019s fantasy that somebody, someday is gonna write them a script \u2014 and when you\u2019re on every page? It\u2019s pretty exciting,\u201d says Elliott, sharing a booth with Haley at a Santa Monica fish joint.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was a love letter not only to Sam, but to a dying breed of actor and film in Hollywood,\u201d Haley says. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we as society tend to chew up people and then spit them out when we\u2019re tired of them. To keep that Meryl Streep or Tom Hanks thing? It\u2019s rare. Or we typecast \u2014 \u2018You\u2019re one thing. Keep doing that.\u2019 We like to keep people in the box.\u201d\n\n92441176 Watch star Sam Elliott and director Brett Haley talk about filming a stoner scene in "The Hero." (Video by Myung J. Chun and Amy Kaufman)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been periods in my life where I\u2019ve thought, \u2018Man, am I ever going to get out of this western box?\u2019 \u201d Elliott admits. He went on to tell a story about how excited he was when he learned that Joel and Ethan Coen wanted to cast him in \u201cThe Big Lebowski.\u201d Because the brothers were known for their \u201cwacky characters,\u201d Elliott felt certain the movie would prove to be his \u201cticket out of the box.\u201d But when he read the script for the 1998 film, he was initially dismayed to see he\u2019d again been cast as a cowboy.\n\n\u201cThat part made me think, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve had a blessed career, and if the bulk of it landed on that western side? Then I\u2019m good with it,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, what am I gonna do? Nobody\u2019s ever gonna compare me with a chameleon. I\u2019m not one of those actors that\u2019s gonna come in with a totally different sound. I do what has worked for me for a long time. You can call it not acting, or you can call it whatever you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call it acting,\u201d says Haley.\n\nInitially, Haley \u2014 who works with writing partner Marc Basch on his screenplays \u2014 actually considered writing a straight western for Elliott. (Without spoiling too much, \u201cThe Hero\u201d does contain western elements when Lee\u2019s fantasies about starring in a new film take shape.) The two batted around the idea of the actor playing Judge Roy Bean, a saloon owner and Texan justice of the peace who was known as \u201cThe Law West of the Pecos.\u201d But the filmmaker was told westerns are particularly difficult to finance because they don\u2019t make money overseas.\n\nThat\u2019s bull, Elliott says, using a tad more colorful language. \u201cRight about the end of John Wayne\u2019s period, Hollywood started looking down their noses at westerns. The key cities have always looked down their noses, and all that middle ground have always embraced them. And those people elected the president. They\u2019re still there. It\u2019s L.A. that doesn\u2019t get it. They want to do \u2018The Lone Ranger\u2019 with Johnny Depp playing Tonto. That\u2019s their idea of a western. With all this computerized \u2026 There\u2019s no place for a computer-generated image in a western, to my way of thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Haley says following Elliott\u2019s tirade. \u201cI love that.\u201d\n\nElliott, whose ancestors hail from the southwest, feels a loyalty to the classic genre. He loves the simplicity of westerns \u2014 how nature is a prime character, the clear set of black-and-white values. He\u2019s just a purist, he says.\n\nBut he\u2019s grateful for the opportunity to showcase a different side of himself in \u201cThe Hero.\u201d Haley purposefully tried to portray the older star as a romantic, sexual being, and in the film Lee enters into a relationship with a comedian in her 30s played by Laura Prepon. Was it different filming love scenes with a younger woman?\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he asks, stone-faced. \u201cI remember the first time I kissed Blythe [Danner] in Brett\u2019s other movie. She was very nervous. One of the things she said to me was, \u2018I\u2019ve never kissed a man with a mustache before.\u2019 I thought, \u2018How is that possible?\u2019\u201d\n\nPrepon, however, was less anxious. \u201cShe came in there and just took total \u2026 control of the scene\u201d and Elliott\u2019s mind too, he recalls.\n\nSam Elliott, left, and Laura Prepon in a scene from "The Hero." (Beth Dubber / AP)\n\nHaley has seen first-hand the effect Elliott has on women on and off screen. During the \u201cDreams\u201d press tour, the colleagues attended an AARP screening of the film in Miami that the filmmaker likens to a \u201cJustin Bieber concert.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was packed \u2014 like 700 people \u2014 and when Sam walked out it was like everyone turned into a teenage girl,\u201d he remembers. \u201cPeople go nuts for him.\u201d\n\nSam Elliott poses for a portrait on the beach in Santa Monica. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cI had an experience like it not long ago at the airport,\u201d says Elliott, who has been married to actress Katharine Ross since 1984. \u201cThis woman came up behind me and said, \u2018Are you Sam?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah,\u2019 and she just started jumping up and down. She was a nice-looking woman, there with her husband. And she was just going nuts. And five minutes later it was a woman who worked at the airport \u2014 she just started fanning on me. Incredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d he says. \u201cYou either shine it on and figure you\u2019re above it all or embrace it for what it is. It\u2019s honest. But what they\u2019re in love with is not me personally, it\u2019s the guy that I take to work. This is what I do. It\u2019s not who I am. I think it\u2019s all about live streaming and the fact that you can\u2019t get away from \u2018Roadhouse\u2019 or \u2018Tombstone\u2019 or \u2018The Big Lebowski.\u2019 I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m still working on some level.\u201d\n\nWhile Elliott finishes work on \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d Haley just wrapped a music video for rock band the War on Drugs and is about to start his next film this summer. They\u2019re busy, and because they live across the country from one another, these days they mostly keep in touch via text message. Still, they encounter those who are perplexed by a friendship between two people with an age difference of nearly four decades between them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t often see friendships between younger people and older people,\u201d says Haley. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s so fulfilling both ways. Because I learn from Sam. He has experience not only within this industry, but just as a father and a husband and a human being that I can learn from. And I think hopefully to some degree, being around a young person who has a certain energy -- it goes both ways.\u201d\n\nBrett Haley, left, and Sam Elliott jokingly brush their hair back at the same time. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like family,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhen I hang up the phone with Sam, I tell him I love him, usually. Because, I mean, we love each other. Well, I love him -- I don\u2019t know if he loves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Elliott says, scoffing. \u201cA real mystery for you still?

Always keep them wanting more.\u201d\n\nSpecial report: The past, present and uncertain future of the multiplex \xbb\n\namy.kaufman@latimes.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter @AmyKinLA\n\nALSO\n\nZoe Lister-Jones made \'Band-Aid\' with an all-female crew.
